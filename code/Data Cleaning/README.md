### Patents general cleaning 

The first thing is to remove patents without abstract, that are not too useful.
Then we are gonna consider only the first three char og the classification in order to elevate abstraction and not have too many classes, dangerous for classification and difficult to be managed.
The last thig is going to delete patetns with no citation or with only external citation, or better all the patents that will not be part of the ciation networ.


```python
#deleting patetns without abstract
patents = patents[patents.abstract.notna()]

 #fill null value for class
patents["class"].fillna(value="NAN",inplace = True) 

 #take first tre character of the class
patents['class'] = patents['class'].astype('str').apply(lambda x: x[:3] if len(x) >= 3 else 'NAN')

patents = patents[['title','publication date','citations','abstract', 'class']]
patents['year'] = patents['publication date'].str[:4]
patents.rename(mapper={'publication date':'pub_date','result_link':'link'}, axis=1, inplace=True)

#take only gG06 and H04  -->     ids["class"] = ids["class"].apply(lambda x: 'NAN' if x.find('G06')<0 and x.find('H04')<0 else x)
#deleids['abstract'] = ids['abstract'].str.replace(r'[^\x00-\x7F]+', '')]].drop([['assignee','']])
print(patents.isnull().sum())
print('length is',len(patents))


```

    citations    0

```python
G = nx.Graph()

for code, patent in patents.iterrows():
    if patent['citations'] != '[]': #citation is a string represetnation of a list 
        for l in str(patent['citations'][1:-1]).split(','):
            link = l.replace(" ","")[1:-1]
            if link in patents.index and link!=code: 
                G.add_edge(code, str(link) )

patents = patents.loc[[node for node in G.nodes]]
print(len(G.nodes),len(patents))

    the prediction of terrorist network and identifying main actors is an important issue for intelligence and security informatics in this article we present a method to analyze social network using machine learning techniques the proposed technique uses k-core concept to remove unwanted and passive nodes from the whole network it then extracts multiple features and uses hybrid classifier to identify main actors the proposed technique is tested on a publicly available dataset and results show significance of proposed system association for computing machinery 
    contemporary theories of social emancipation contend that it is time to dispense with the concept of revolution and leave it merely as the legacy of political struggles belonging to the age of industrial economy today's globalization semio-capital speculative design crypto-economy and artificial intelligence would engage epistemologically different emancipatory lexicons and techniques of resistance all new futurisms posit technological solutions for hitherto political stakes what remains unheeded in them is the existential need for cognitive equality and social continuity with the masses in constructing the collective subject of emancipation recent election results in the u s u k eastern europe and russia diagnose an immense cognitive rupture between the producers of emancipatory lexicons and disadvantaged workers such a split between mind and body was already made apparent in hegel's dialectics of lord and bondsman in order to surpass this split it is of utmost importance to reconsider the conditions in which the premature construction of the proletariat took place in the context of the october revolution the proletariat was posited in this case not only as revolutionary subject but as the principal subject of enlightenment as well eusp 
    early detection of new kinds of malware always plays an important role in defending the network systems especially if intelligent protection systems could themselves detect an existence of new malware types in their system even with a very small number of malware samples it must be a huge benefit for the organization as well as the social since it help preventing the spreading of that kind of malware to deal with learning from few samples term 'one-shot learning' or 'fewshot learning' was introduced and mostly used in computer vision to recognize images handwriting etc an approach introduced in this paper takes advantage of one-shot learning algorithms in solving the malware classification problem by using memory augmented neural network in combination with malware's api calls sequence which is a very valuable source of information for identifying malware behavior in addition it also use some advantages of the development in natural language processing field such as wordvec etc to convert those api sequences to numeric vectors before feeding to the one-shot learning network the results confirm very good accuracies compared to the other traditional methods ieee 
    given the ubiquity of artificial intelligence (ai) in modern societies it is clear that individuals corporations and countries will be grappling with the legal and ethical issues of its use as global problems require global solutions we propose the establishment of an international ai regulatory agency that - drawing on interdisciplinary expertise - could create a unified framework for the regulation of ai technologies and inform the development of ai policies around the world we urge that such an organization be developed with all deliberate haste as issues such as cryptocurrencies personalized political ad hacking autonomous vehicles and autonomous weaponized agents are already a reality affecting international trade politics and war acm 
    it has been recently shown that deep neural networks (dnns) are susceptible to a particular type of attack that exploits a fundamental flaw in their design this attack consists of generating particular synthetic examples referred to as adversarial samples these samples are constructed by slightly manipulating real data-points that change 'fool' the original dnn model forcing it to misclassify previously correctly classified samples with high confidence many believe addressing this flaw is essential for dnns to be used in critical applications such as cyber security previous work has shown that learning algorithms that enhance the robustness of dnn models all use the tactic of 'security through obscurity' this means that security can be guaranteed only if one can obscure the learning algorithms from adversaries once the learning technique is disclosed dnns protected by these defense mechanisms are still susceptible to adversarial samples in this work we investigate by examining how previous research dealt with this and propose a generic approach to enhance a dnn's resistance to adversarial samples more specifically our approach integrates a data transformation module with a dnn making it robust even if we reveal the underlying learning algorithm to demonstrate the generality of our proposed approach and its potential for handling cyber security applications we evaluate our method and several other existing solutions on datasets publicly available such as a large scale malware dataset and mnist and imdb datasets our results indicate that our approach typically provides superior classification performance and robustness to attacks compared with state-of-art solutions ieee 
    the use of social media tools by individuals and organizations has substantially increased in recent years the emergence of smartphones and gadgets in particular is boosting their prevalence social media leaves space for nearly every internet user entity to contribute on one hand social media represents an opportunity to reach out to a large audience for many benign applications such as advertisements e-commerce establishing friendships and knowledge sharing on the other social media is an outlet for many miscreants and criminals to spread their messages and commit crimes well-known examples of such abuses include the promotion of terrorism and the recruitment of youth into terrorist groups using twitter and the like this paper studies the twitter profiles of extremists and proposes a technique for automatically detecting these profiles achieving a high detection accuracy would help raise awareness about potential terrorist profiles allowing law enforcement agencies to take legal measures against these accounts (such as blocking them or asking twitter to close them) the focus of this paper is on arabic-based profiles as arabic is the main language used for communication in the kingdom of saudi arabia ieee

    to adapt to the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats efficient collection and analysis of cyber threat intelligence (cti) is crucial for safety staff to implement a proactive cyber defense such as security hardening or incident responding however with the exponential increase in open source information cyber threat intelligence becomes increasing hard to gather from wild open source by human efforts furthermore autonomous determining cyber intelligent information with respect to relevant threats reported or newsletter remains a challenge largely due to the lack of corresponding principles or rules to analyze semantics and contextual information that present in textual representations to overcome these limitation this paper propose a security open source intelligence framework (osif) to automatically analyze unstructured text for generating event based cyber threat intelligent it uses several technologies such as natural language process machine learning and data mining to extract cybersecurity event related information (device organization location etc ) and common vulnerabilities and exposure (cve) for threat actor profiling finally we perform a comprehensive structural and conceptual evaluation of critical threats on dataset that collected from dozens of websites and the experiments that conducted on the dataset demonstrate that our approach have a considerable performance ieee 
    artificial neural networks have gained prominence by being used in different aspects such as medical diagnosis and detecting malware applications however neural network models could have an error rate that indicates their performance thus optimization algorithms can minimize the error rate by updating the neural network parameters to reach an optimal solution this paper explores the use of permissions and underlying linux system information features in android platform to evaluate gradient descent optimization algorithms in neural networks those optimizers are evaluated by running them on a set of android applications to find the optimum one furthermore each optimizer is assessed based on its default and adjusted parameters values this evaluation shows that the best accuracy score is % collected by adam optimizer ieee 
    a forensics investigation after a breach often uncovers network and host indicators of compromise (iocs) that can be deployed to sensors to allow early detection of the adversary in the future over time the adversary will change tactics techniques and procedures (ttps) which will also change the data generated if the iocs are not kept up-to-date with the adversary's new ttps the adversary will no longer be detected once all of the iocs become invalid tracking the known (ttk) is the problem of keeping iocs in this case regular expression (regexes) up-to-date with a dynamic adversary our framework solves the ttk problem in an automated cyclic fashion to bracket a previously discovered adversary this tracking is accomplished through a data-driven approach of self-adapting a given model based on its own detection capabilities in our initial experiments we found that the true positive rate (tpr) of the adaptive solution degrades much less significantly over time than the nave solution suggesting that self-updating the model allows the continued detection of positives (i e adversaries) the cost for this performance is in the false positive rate (fpr) which increases over time for the adaptive solution but remains constant for the nave solution however the difference in overall detection performance as measured by the area under the curve (auc) between the two methods is negligible this result suggests that self-updating the model over time should be done in practice to continue to detect known evolving adversaries ieee

    most current literature on android malware pays particular attention to the features of applications much of them focus on permissions or apis neglecting the behavioral semantics of applications and the literature considering behavioral semantics is often expensive and weak in extendibility in this paper we introduce repassdroid-a relatively coarse-grained but faster tool for automatic android malware detection we define generalized-sensitive api and emphasize on considering if the trigger points of generalized-sensitive apis are ui-related or not it analyzes the application by abstracting the generalized sensitive api with its trigger point as the semantic feature with the addition of really-essential permission as the syntax feature then it utilizes machine learning to automatically determine whether an application is benign or malicious we evaluate repassdroid on samples in total for training and for test with the comparative experiments we find that random forest is the optimal classification technique for our feature set achieving % accuracy and auc along with a malware classification precision as high as % our evaluation results confirm that our approach and the feature set are logical and effective for android malware detection ieee

    a remote access trojan (rat) is a form of malware which once installed on the victim's machine passes command and control (c) back to the attacker rats can be used to steal sensitive information spy on victims and remotely control infected hosts rats are increasingly difficult to detect because they behave in ways that many firewalls and other cybersecurity tools do not perceive as malicious in this research we demonstrate how a rat can be identified by searching for evidence left behind after the attack our approach is based on the locard principle which essentially states that when an intruder comes into contact with an environment the intruder leaves some form of forensic evidence behind inspired by this principle we started the hunt for a specific virus ghst rat we know that the rat has to contact the command and control so we looked for evidence in the network traffic by using the wireshark software viruses can hide but they still have to run so we performed forensic analysis of the memory using the volatility software to locate any evidence of the rat we also searched for evidence of the rat on the hard drive we are pleased to report that we were able to find traces of ghst in both the network traffic running in memory and on the hard drive ieee

    modern malware applies a rich arsenal of evasion techniques to render dynamic analysis ineffective in turn dynamic analysis tools take great pains to hide themselves from malware typically this entails trying to be as faithful as possible to the behavior of a real run we present a novel approach to malware analysis that turns this idea on its head using an extreme abstraction of the operating system that intentionally strays from real behavior the key insight is that the presence of malicious behavior is sufficient evidence of malicious intent even if the path taken is not one that could occur during a real run of the sample by exploring multiple paths in a system that only approximates the behavior of a real system we can discover behavior that would often be hard to elicit otherwise we aggregate features from multiple paths and use a funnel-like configuration of machine learning classiers to achieve high accuracy without incurring too much of a performance penalty we describe our system tamales (the abstract malware analysis learning system) in detail and present machine learning results using a k sample set showing an fpr (false positive rate) of % with a tpr (true positive rate) of % demonstrating that extreme abstraction can be extraordinarily effective in providing data that allows a classifier to accurately detect malware copyright held by the owner author(s) publication rights licensed to the association for computing machinery

    the cyber defenses of critical infrastructures require early detection of new threats and attacks this includes defensive systems that are able to learn from novel attacks and to detect -day vulnerabilities as early as possible honeypots are not defensive systems based on prevention but they still represent an effective way to gather information about attacks from the source nevertheless most existing solutions operate in a stateless way as a consequence they are easily identified by expert attackers and they are unable to track progress of individual attacks in large applications we propose a novel approach that enables a so called stateful honeypot the idea comes from the observation that a typical cyber attack to a critical infrastructure is carried out through multiple attempts and intrusions hence the main goal is to fingerprint each attacker by observing and registering his adopted methods tools and actions once identified the adversary is redirected to his specific environment that preserves the history of his previous operations including the installation of rootkits or backdoors the proposed solution paves the way to a more effective generation of honeypots that are necessary to face the augmented complexity of cyber attacks ieee

    over the past decade formal and anecdotal reports claim that pirated software spreads malware malware can be used to steal personal and financial information and organized crime groups may be exploiting these activities to help carry out and finance their operations this study looked at trends in secondary data regarding malware distribution pirated software data breaches and the commission of identity crimes analyzing authoritative data from to shows the correlation between pirated software and the number of records exposed in data breaches is statistically insignificant the number of data breaches cannot be used confidently to predict increases or decreases in identity crimes so pirated software and data breaches cannot be definitively established as root causes of identity crime the specifics of organized criminal involvement in pirated software distribution and identity crimes merits further research since those activities could only be inferred from the literature used in this study ieee 
    understanding how relationships are structured in physician networks provides insights into how these networks influence physicians beliefs and behaviors this understanding would help improve strategies for disseminating medical information and guidelines but most physician social networks mainly focus on a binary relationship where either one physician is connected or not connected to another physician without any description about the strength of the relationship this binary relationship can lead to misinformation in the network (as acquaintances and close friends may be treated equally) in this paper we overcome the limitation of the binary relationship by proposing a weighted influence approach among a network of physicians a physician network is a social graph comprising of nodes (physicians) and edges between nodes (social relationships) specifically we attach weights to the edges to quantify the strength of the relationship between two connected physicians in one network we assume an un-weighted (binary) link between two connected physicians whereas in a second network we assume a weighted link between two physicians in both networks edges are created between physicians who are affiliated with the same organization-group and affiliated or working in the same hospital within the same specialty or specialty-group we compare both the weighted and un-weighted approaches in the network by considering the diffusion of four highly prescribed pain medications in the us results reveal that the weighted approach is superior compared to the un-weighted approach network in explaining the diffusion of pain medications inside the social network additionally our results help us identify that affiliation to the same organization-group and affiliation to the same hospital are important attributes to the diffusion process additionally weights with high values do not necessarily lead to large diffusions inside the social network we highlight the implication of our results for the diffusion of innovations in physician networks springer-verlag gmbh austria part of springer nature

    malicious software also known as 'malware' is software that uses legitimate instructions or code to perform malicious actions malware poses a major threat for computer security and information security in general over the years malware has evolved to the point that a single malware specimen can have hundreds or maybe thousands of variants using polymorphic and metamorphic transformation to change the signature of the malware variant in propagation the common signature-based malware detection methods are no longer robust to detect these variants due to the alteration of code static analysis is required to obtain these signatures and anti-virus companies are required to propagate these signature updates to their software a faster detection method is needed to compensate the exponentially increasing number of malware variants machine learning is a trending approach for malware detection this removes the need to use signature-based detection and is also faster software companies do not need to propagate signatures as often machine learning algorithms using opcode sequences can recognise patterns in the malicious code that are not present in common signatures and classify them more efficiently therefore a machine learning approach for malware detection should be adopted for faster and more efficient detection most research in malware detection using machine learning used static attributes such as network connections processes spawned hashes etc that were not that robust to changes in this paper we introduced our novel approach in using trigrams and pe file attributes as features for malware detection we took a text mining approach to make our detection method more robust to polymorphism and metamorphism the instruction sequence for critical code in malware on the assembly level is basically the same across malware families we used opcode trigram sequences as the main feature for our machine learning algorithm we used support vector machine(svm) as our classifying algorithm which is a discriminative classifier model that gives a definite decision whether the predicted outcome belongs to the learned class or not the above shows our novel approach that enabled us to get higher detection rates with less features university of split fesb

    the prevalence of social media has made information sharing possible across the globe the downside unfortunately is the wide spread of misinformation methods applied in most previous rumor classifiers give an equal weight or attention to words in the microblog and do not take the context beyond microblog contents into account therefore the accuracy becomes plateaued in this research we propose an ensemble neural architecture to detect rumor on twitter the architecture incorporates word attention and context from the author to enhance the classification performance in particular the word-level attention mechanism enables the architecture to put more emphasis on important words when constructing the text representation to derive further context microblog posts composed by individual authors are exploited since they can reflect style and characteristics in spreading information which are significant cues to help classify whether the shared content is rumor or legitimate news the experiment on the real-world twitter dataset collected from two well-known rumor tracking websites demonstrates promising results ieee

    malware writers are usually focused on those platforms which are most used among common users with the aim of attacking as many devices as possible due to this reason android has been heavily attacked for years efforts dedicated to combat android malware are mainly concentrated on detection in order to prevent malicious software to be installed in a target device however it is equally important to put effort into an automatic classification of the type or family of a malware sample in order to establish which actions are necessary to mitigate the damage caused in this paper we present candyman a tool that classifies android malware families by combining dynamic analysis and markov chains a dynamic analysis process allows to extract representative information of a malware sample in form of a sequence of states while a markov chain allows to model the transition probabilities between the states of the sequence which will be used as features in the classification process the space of features built is used to train classical machine learning including methods for imbalanced learning and deep learning algorithms over a dataset of malware samples from different families in order to evaluate the proposed method using a collection of malware samples grouped into different families (extracted from the drebin dataset) and once made a selection based on a minimum number of relevant and valid samples a final set of samples grouped into different malware families was used the experimental results indicate a precision performance of % over this dataset 
    for some time now artificial intelligence(al) has been receiving unprecedented attention why is this?because it is making a genuine leap forward as a combined result of four factors the rapid advance in communications that sends all forms of expression hurtling across the planet at the speed of light computer processing power (now measured in quadrillions of operations per second) the explosion of available data and the progress of machine learning hence as andr-yves portnoff and jean-frangois soupizet assert a whole new ecosystem is emerging what might the applications of al be? there are already countless possible uses ranging from the milking of goats banking services autonomous vehicles digital marketing and smart cities to health and sabotage some experts who subscribe to the "technological singularity" theory even believe that al could take over the planet an assertion staunchly contested here by our authors who do however stress how much the division of roles between men and machines needs to be rethought as does the relationship between them they also point out incidentally that the spread of al within businesses hasn't gone as far as all that since that would imply profound changes in forms of organization and management-in short a cultural revolution and culture does not move at the same pace as technological advance!turning to the question of the players involved they stress the conflict between the new entrants (the american and chinese internet giants) and traditional companies together with states whose sovereignty is seriously impaired as a result but these latter may discover that al affords them the means to restore their power for better or for worse in years to come drawing in this article on a foresight analysis carried out for the members of the futur- ibles international association andr-yves portnoff and jean-francois soupizet venture to outline a number of possible futures these are not scenarios properly so-called but contrasting models they include the "privatized digital panopticon" characterized by the supremacy of the digital giants the "statized digital panopticon" which would see the chinese regime and the it giants coming together in their own shared interest the "enlightened long-termist" model and that of "digital criminalities" in doing so the authors show once again how technologies are double-edged and how it is important that we-and particularly we europeans-take responsibility when choices are being made that will undoubtedly shape the future for many years to come futuribles all rights reserved

    a homoglyph (name spoofing) attack is a common technique used by adversaries to obfuscate file and domain names this technique creates process or domain names that are visually similar to legitimate and recognized names for instance an attacker may create malware with the name svchst exe so that in a visual inspection of running processes or a directory listing the process or file name might be mistaken as the windows system process svchost exe there has been limited published research on detecting homoglyph attacks current approaches rely on string comparison algorithms (such as levenshtein distance) that result in computationally heavy solutions with a high number of false positives in addition there is a deficiency in the number of publicly available datasets for reproducible research with most datasets focused on phishing attacks in which homoglyphs are not always used this paper presents a fundamentally different solution to this problem using a siamese convolutional neural network (cnn) rather than leveraging similarity based on character swaps and deletions this technique uses a learned metric on strings rendered as images a cnn learns features that are optimized to detect visual similarity of the rendered strings the trained model is used to convert thousands of potentially targeted process or domain names to feature vectors these feature vectors are indexed using randomized kd-trees to make similarity searches extremely fast with minimal computational processing this technique shows a considerable % to % improvement over baseline techniques in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (roc auc) in addition we provide both code and data to further future research ieee 
    detection systems based on machine learning models are essential tools for system and enterprise defense these systems construct models of attacks (or non-attacks) from past observations (i e features) using a training algorithm after that the detection systems use that model for detection at run-time in this way the detection system recognizes when the environmental state becomes - at least probabilistically - dangerous a limitation of this traditional model of detection is that model training is limited to features available at run-time however many features are either too expensive to collect in real-time or only available after the fact in traditional detection such features are ignored for the purpose of detection in this paper we consider an alternative detection model learning approach generalized distillation that trains models using privileged information - features available at training time but not at run-time-to improve the accuracy of detection systems we use a deep neural network to implement generalized distillation for the training of detection models and making predictions our empirical study shows that detection with privileged information via generalized distillation increases precision and recall in systems of user face authentication fast-flux bot detection and malware classification over systems with no privileged information ieee

    at a time when all it takes to open a twitter account is a mobile phone the act of authenticating information encountered on social media becomes very complex especially when we lack measures to verify digital identities in the first place because the platform supports anonymity fake news generated by dubious sources have been observed to travel much faster and farther than real news hence we need valid measures to identify authors of misinformation to avert these consequences researchers propose different authorship attribution techniques to approach this kind of problem however because tweets are made up of only characters finding a suitable authorship attribution technique is a challenge this research aims to classify authors of tweets by comparing machine learning methods like logistic regression and naive bayes the processes of this application are fetching of tweets pre-processing feature extraction and developing a machine learning model for classification this paper illustrates the text classification for authorship process using machine learning techniques in total there were tweets used as both training and testing data and unique features specific to twitter were extracted several steps were done in the pre-processing phase including removal of short texts removal of stop-words and punctuations tokenizing and stemming of texts as well this approach transforms the pre-processed data into a set of feature vector in python logistic regression and naive bayes algorithms were applied to the set of feature vectors for the training and testing of the classifier the logistic regression based classifier gave the highest accuracy of % compared to the naive bayes classifier with % ieee 
    malicious web content is a serious problem on the internet today in this paper we propose a deep learning approach to detecting malevolent web pages while past work on web content detection has relied on syntactic parsing or on emulation of html and javascript to extract features our approach operates directly on a language-agnostic stream of tokens extracted directly from static html files with a simple regular expression this makes it fast enough to operate in high-frequency data contexts like firewalls and web proxies and allows it to avoid the attack surface exposure of complex parsing and emulation code unlike well-known approaches such as bag-of-words models which ignore spatial information our neural network examines content at hierarchical spatial scales allowing our model to capture locality and yielding superior accuracy compared to bag-of-words baselines our proposed architecture achieves a % detection rate at a % false positive rate and classifies small-batched web pages at a rate of over per second on commodity hardware the speed and accuracy of our approach makes it appropriate for deployment to endpoints firewalls and web proxies ieee

    currently malware is one of the most serious threats to internet security in this paper we propose a malware classification algorithm that uses static features called mcsc (malware classification using simhash and cnn) which converts the disassembled malware codes into gray images based on simhash and then identifies their families by convolutional neural network during this process some methods such as multi-hash major block selection and bilinear interpolation are used to improve the performance experimental results show that mcsc is very effective for malware family classification even for those unevenly distributed samples the classification accuracy can be % at best and % at average on a malware dataset of samples which is higher than other compared algorithms moreover for mcsc on average it just takes s to recognize a new sample which can meet the requirements in most of the practical applications elsevier ltd
    static malware analysis is well-suited to endpoint anti-virus systems as it can be conducted quickly by examining the features of an executable piece of code and matching it to previously observed malicious code however static code analysis can be vulnerable to code obfuscation techniques behavioural data collected during file execution is more difficult to obfuscate but takes a relatively long time to capture - typically up to min meaning the malicious payload has likely already been delivered by the time it is detected in this paper we investigate the possibility of predicting whether or not an executable is malicious based on a short snapshot of behavioural data we find that an ensemble of recurrent neural networks are able to predict whether an executable is malicious or benign within the first s of execution with % accuracy this is the first time general types of malicious file have been predicted to be malicious during execution rather than using a complete activity log file post-execution and enables cyber security endpoint protection to be advanced to use behavioural data for blocking malicious payloads rather than detecting them post-execution and having to repair the damage the authors
    in the attention to the fake news phenomenon drastically increased mobile devices such as cellular phones and sources of information such as social networks are instruments that enable individuals to receive news publish posts communicate with peers watch videos listen to music etc in today's highly mobile society this is a current trend the uncontrolled freedom and simplicity in publications on the internet result in overwhelming users receiving news that are fake and hoaxes detecting and filtering such information is a challenging problem this paper discusses different approaches to combat fake news they are used to a) determine text features utilizing linguistic natural language processing methods (it is necessary to create a profile of the text document) b) detect spam bots in social networks to isolate those using machine-learning methods (it is crucial to reduce the number of analyzed documents) and c) confirm the facts in online documents by applying techniques used in search engines (it is very much important to select trusted documents) a system combining these mechanisms may demonstrate a high level of accuracy in filtering fake news ieee

    to what extent could big data predict the results of the u s presidential election better than more conventional sources of aggregate measures? to test this idea the present research used google search trends versus other forms of state-level data (i e both behavioral measures like the incidence of hate crimes hate groups and police brutality and implicit measures like implicit association test (iat) data) to predict each states popular vote for the presidential election results demonstrate that when taken in isolation zero-order correlations reveal that prevalence of hate groups prevalence of hate crimes google searches for racially charged terms (i e related to white supremacy groups racial slurs and the nazi movement) and political conservatism were all significant predictors of popular support for trump however subsequent hierarchical regression analyses show that when these predictors are considered simultaneously only google search data for historical white supremacy terms (e g adolf hitler) uniquely predicted election outcomes earlier and beyond political conservatism thus big data in the form of google search emerged as a more potent predictor of political behavior than other aggregate measures including implicit attitudes and behavioral measures of racial bias implications for the role of racial bias in the presidential election in particular and the utility of google search data more generally are discussed the author(s)

    survivors of intimate partner violence increasingly report that abusers install spyware on devices to track their location monitor communications and cause emotional and physical harm to date there has been only cursory investigation into the spyware used in such intimate partner surveillance (ips) we provide the first in-depth study of the ips spyware ecosystem we design implement and evaluate a measurement pipeline that combines web and app store crawling with machine learning to find and label apps that are potentially dangerous in ips contexts ultimately we identify several hundred such ips-relevant apps while we find dozens of overt spyware tools the majority are 'dual-use' apps - they have a legitimate purpose (e g child safety or anti-theft) but are easily and effectively repurposed for spying on a partner we document that a wealth of online resources are available to educate abusers about exploiting apps for ips we also show how some dual-use app developers are encouraging their use in ips via advertisements blogs and customer support services we analyze existing anti-virus and anti-spyware tools which universally fail to identify dual-use apps as a threat ieee 
    the successful use of online material in political campaigns over the past two decades has motivated the inclusion of social media platforms - such as twitter - as an integral part of the political apparatus political analysts are increasingly turning to twitter as an indicator of public opinion we are interested in learning how positive and negative opinions propagate through twitter and how important events influence public opinion in this paper we present a neural network-based approach to analyse the sentiment expressed on political tweets first our approach represents the text by dense vectors comprising subword information to better detect word similarities by exploiting both morphology and semantics then a convolutional neural network is trained to learn how to classify tweets depending on sentiment based on an available labelled dataset finally the model is applied to perform the sentiment analysis of a collection of tweets retrieved during the days prior to the latest uk general election results are promising and show that the neural network approach represents an improvement over lexicon-based approaches for positive negative sentence classification ieee 
    the ever-growing number of cyber-attacks over the last few years has put both individuals as well as large-scale organisations in a state-of-emergency situation in the dawn of a big data internet-of-things era the discovery and use of personal information for individual profiling raises significant information privacy concerns challenging regulators around the globe as hearing aids are often the most effective therapeutic measure for an individual with hearing loss the number of active devices that could be potentially cyber-controlled and used for malicious reasons suggests that this threat is not to be taken lightly the aim of this paper is to identify how cyber-security and privacy concerns have arisen over the last years based on the advances in the communication protocols used by hearing aids and their security the identification of potential hacking and cyber-attacking methods aimed at these devices and the need for potential countermeasures and actions to be taken more seriously in order to ensure patients' privacy ieee 
    as news reading on social media becomes more and more popular fake news becomes a major issue concerning the public and government the fake news can take advantage of multimedia content to mislead readers and get dissemination which can cause negative effects or even manipulate the public events one of the unique challenges for fake news detection on social media is how to identify fake news on newly emerged events unfortunately most of the existing approaches can hardly handle this challenge since they tend to learn event-specific features that can not be transferred to unseen events in order to address this issue we propose an end-to-end framework named event adversarial neural network (eann) which can derive event-invariant features and thus benefit the detection of fake news on newly arrived events it consists of three main components the multi-modal feature extractor the fake news detector and the event discriminator the multi-modal feature extractor is responsible for extracting the textual and visual features from posts it cooperates with the fake news detector to learn the discriminable representation for the detection of fake news the role of event discriminator is to remove the event-specific features and keep shared features among events extensive experiments are conducted on multimedia datasets collected from weibo and twitter the experimental results show our proposed eann model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods and learn transferable feature representations association for computing machinery

    machine learning (ml) systems have been increasingly applied in web security applications such as spammer detection malware detection and fraud detection these applications have an intrinsic adversarial nature where intelligent attackers can adaptively change their behaviors to avoid being detected by the deployed detectors existing efforts against adversaries are usually limited by the type of applied ml models or the specific applications such as image classification additionally the working mechanisms of ml models usually cannot be well understood by users which in turn impede them from understanding the vulnerabilities of models nor improving their robustness to bridge the gap in this paper we propose to investigate whether model interpretation could potentially help adversarial detection specifically we develop a novel adversary-resistant detection framework by utilizing the interpretation of ml models the interpretation process explains the mechanism of how the target ml model makes prediction for a given instance thus providing more insights for crafting adversarial samples the robustness of detectors is then improved through adversarial training with the adversarial samples a data-driven method is also developed to empirically estimate costs of adversaries in feature manipulation our approach is model-agnostic and can be applied to various types of classification models our experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of interpretation-based attacks and how estimated feature manipulation cost would affect the behavior of adversaries association for computing machinery

    cloud computing is one of today's most popular and important it trends currently most organizations use cloud computing services (public or private) as part of their computer infrastructure virtualization technology is at the core of cloud computing and virtual resources such as virtual servers are commonly used to provide services to the entire organization due to their importance and prevalence virtual servers in an organizational cloud are constantly targeted by cyber-attackers who try to inject malicious code or malware into the server (e g ransomware) many times server administrators are not aware that the server has been compromised despite the presence of detection solutions on the server (e g antivirus engine) in other cases the breach is detected after a long period of time when significant damage has already occurred thus detecting that a virtual server has been compromised is extremely important for organizational security existing security solutions that are installed on the server (e g antivirus) are considered untrusted since malware (particularly sophisticated ones) can evade them moreover these tools are largely incapable of detecting new unknown malware machine learning (ml) methods have been shown to be effective at detecting malware in various domains in this paper we present a novel methodology for trusted detection of ransomware in virtual servers on an organization's private cloud we conducted trusted analysis of volatile memory dumps taken from a virtual machine (memory forensics) using the volatility framework and created general descriptive meta-features we leveraged these meta-features using machine learning algorithms for the detection of unknown ransomware in virtual servers we evaluated our methodology extensively in five comprehensive experiments of increasing difficulty on two different popular servers (iis server and an email server) we used a collection of real-world professional and notorious ransomware and a collection of legitimate programs the results show that our methodology is able to detect anomalous states of a virtual machine as well as the presence of both known and unknown ransomware obtaining the following results tpr = fpr = f-measure = and auc = using the random forest classifier finally we showed that our proposed methodology is also capable of detecting an additional type of malware known as a remote access trojan (rat) which is used to attack organizational vms elsevier ltd
    the increasing amount of malware variants seen in the wild is causing problems for antivirus software vendors unable to keep up by creating signatures for each the methods used to develop a signature static and dynamic analysis have various limitations machine learning has been used by antivirus vendors to detect malware based on the information gathered from the analysis process however adversarial examples can cause machine learning algorithms to miss-classify new data in this paper we describe a method for malware analysis by converting malware binaries to images and then preparing those images for training within a generative adversarial network these unsupervised deep neural networks are not susceptible to adversarial examples the conversion to images from malware binaries should be faster than using dynamic analysis and it would still be possible to link malware families together using the generative adversarial network malware detection could be much more effective and reliable ieee

    android applications are usually obfuscated before release making it difficult to analyze them for malware presence or intellectual property violations obfuscators might hide the true intent of code by renaming variables and or modifying program structures it is challenging to search for executables relevant to an obfuscated application for developers to analyze efficiently prior approaches toward obfuscation resilient search have relied on certain structural parts of apps remaining as landmarks untouched by obfuscation for instance some prior approaches have assumed that the structural relationships between identifiers are not broken by obfuscators others have assumed that control flow graphs maintain their structures both approaches can be easily defeated by a motivated obfuscator we present a new approach macneto to search for programs relevant to obfuscated executables leveraging deep learning and principal components on instructions macneto makes few assumptions about the kinds of modifications that an obfuscator might perform we show that it has high search precision for executables obfuscated by a state-of-the-art obfuscator that changes control flow further we also demonstrate the potential of macneto to help developers understand executables where macneto infers keywords (which are from relevant un-obfuscated programs) for obfuscated executables acm

    the stable election protocol (sep) is an improved algorithm of the low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (leach) in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (wsn) to improve the life cycle however the unbalanced energy consumption of cluster heads and the nodes would decrease the lifetime on the one hand add the node energy to the election of cluster head to reduce the energy consumption of cluster heads on the other hand decrease the energy consumption of the nodes in the cluster through the indirect transmission by intermediate nodes at least greedy routing algorithm is also be used to find the best route the results show that the improved sep protocol works well in balancing the energy consumption to improve the lifetime comparing leach protocol and sep protocol with the improved sep protocol by matlab ieee

    as mobile phones become more ubiquitous in our daily lives many malware creators have shifted their focus to these mobile platforms while a plethora of work exists to try and detect malware as it is uploaded to app stores and when it is downloaded to user devices malware still slips through a lesser body of work has suggested that hardware performance counters (hpcs) can provide an insight into detecting malware as it runs while these works have been successful they typically require thread-level sampling rates every tens of thousands of instructions and hundreds of kb s to mb s of bus bandwidth resulting in high power overhead in battery constrained mobile devices unlike previous works this paper proposes a coarser grained approach requiring system-wide sampling rates in the hundreds of hz and less than kb s of bandwidth all while achieving similar accuracy to previous works and identification of zero-day attacks the proposed method focuses purely on background detection that is detection of malware when its parent application is inactive this technique relies upon a multi-layer neural network to extract the higher order dependencies between different hpcs as processes are executed on multiple cores experiments are conducted on a motorola g platform and classifiers are trained with multiple families of malware and a multitude of clean system states ieee

    malicious software poses serious threats to our lives and the activity to detect malware is becoming more and more important an effective approach is to train a classifier using known software samples and malware samples and recognize malware from new software to do that a recent popular trend is to use opcode which is extracted from executable modules as an expression of software entities to drive machine learning however we found that the effectiveness of such a framework highly suffers from having insufficient samples which is caused by the low success rate of disassembly due to the intrinsic complexity of the problem in this paper we propose to increase the success rate of disassembly by allowing inaccurate disassembling with the attempt to increase the number of successful disassembled samples to improve opcode-driven malware detection we built a lightweight disassembler d-light based on the linear swap disassembly method to avoid known issues with the recursive descent manner of ida pro we carried out experiment to evaluate the performance effectiveness and other design factors of adopting d-light and ida pro as disassemblers for malware detection the empirical study shows the d-light is both more efficient and more effective than ida pro in supporting malware detection ieee 
    an important source of cyber-attacks is malware which proliferates in different forms such as botnets the botnet malware typically looks for vulnerable devices across the internet rather than targeting specific individuals companies or industries it attempts to infect as many connected devices as possible using their resources for automated tasks that may cause significant economic and social harm while being hidden to the user and device thus it becomes very difficult to detect such activity a considerable amount of research has been conducted to detect and prevent botnet infestation in this paper we attempt to create a foundation for an anomaly-based intrusion detection system using a statistical learning method to improve network security and reduce human involvement in botnet detection we focus on identifying the best features to detect botnet activity within network traffic using a lightweight logistic regression model the network traffic is processed by bro a popular network monitoring framework which provides aggregate statistics about the packets exchanged between a source and destination over a certain time interval these statistics serve as features to a logistic regression model responsible for classifying malicious and benign traffic our model is easy to implement and simple to interpret we characterized and modeled different botnet families separately and as a mixed dataset finally we measured the performance of our model on multiple parameters using f score accuracy and area under curve (auc) ieee

    many existing machine learning (ml) based android malware detection approaches use a variety of features such as security-sensitive apis system calls control-flow structures and information flows in conjunction with ml classifiers to achieve accurate detection each of these feature sets provides a unique semantic perspective (or view) of apps behaviors with inherent strengths and limitations meaning some views are more amenable to detect certain attacks but may not be suitable to characterize several other attacks most of the existing malware detection approaches use only one (or a selected few) of the aforementioned feature sets which prevents them from detecting a vast majority of attacks addressing this limitation we propose mkldroid a unified framework that systematically integrates multiple views of apps for performing comprehensive malware detection and malicious code localization the rationale is that while a malware app can disguise itself in some views disguising in every view while maintaining malicious intent will be much harder mkldroid uses a graph kernel to capture structural and contextual information from apps dependency graphs and identify malice code patterns in each view subsequently it employs multiple kernel learning (mkl) to find a weighted combination of the views which yields the best detection accuracy besides multi-view learning mkldroids unique and salient trait is its ability to locate fine-grained malice code portions in dependency graphs (e g methods classes) malicious code localization caters several important applications such as supporting human analysts studying malware behaviors engineering malware signatures and other counter-measures through our large-scale experiments on several datasets (incl wild apps) we demonstrate that mkldroid outperforms three state-of-the-art techniques consistently in terms of accuracy while maintaining comparable efficiency in our malicious code localization experiments on a dataset of repackaged malware mkldroid was able to identify all the malice classes with % average recall our work opens up two new avenues in malware research (i) enables the research community to elegantly look at android malware behaviors in multiple perspectives simultaneously and (ii) performing precise and scalable malicious code localization springer science business media llc

    microsoft's powershell is a command-line shell and scripting language that is installed by default on windows machines based on microsoft's net framework it includes an interface that allows programmers to access operating system services while powershell can be configured by administrators for restricting access and reducing vulnerabilities these restrictions can be bypassed moreover powershell commands can be easily generated dynamically executed from memory encoded and obfuscated thus making the logging and forensic analysis of code executed by powershell challenging for all these reasons powershell is increasingly used by cybercriminals as part of their attacks' tool chain mainly for downloading malicious contents and for lateral movement indeed a recent comprehensive technical report by symantec dedicated to powershell's abuse by cybercrimials [ ] reported on a sharp increase in the number of malicious powershell samples they received and in the number of penetration tools and frameworks that use powershell this highlights the urgent need of developing effective methods for detecting malicious powershell commands in this work we address this challenge by implementing several novel detectors of malicious powershell commands and evaluating their performance we implemented both traditional natural language processing (nlp) based detectors and detectors based on character-level convolutional neural networks (cnns) detectors' performance was evaluated using a large real-world dataset our evaluation results show that although our detectors (and especially the traditional nlp-based ones) individually yield high performance an ensemble detector that combines an nlp-based classifier with a cnn-based classifier provides the best performance since the latter classifier is able to detect malicious commands that succeed in evading the former our analysis of these evasive commands reveals that some obfuscation patterns automatically detected by the cnn classifier are intrinsically difficult to detect using the nlp techniques we applied our detectors provide high recall values while maintaining a very low false positive rate making us cautiously optimistic that they can be of practical value association for computing machinery 
    the ever-increasing prevalence of malware has led to the explorations of various detection mechanisms several recent works propose to use hardware performance counters (hpcs) values with machine learning classiication models for malware detection hpcs are hardware units that record low-level micro-architectural behavior such as cache hits misses branch (mis)prediction and load store operations however this information does not reliably capture the nature of the application i e whether it is benign or malicious in this paper we claim and experimentally support that using the micro-architectural level information obtained from hpcs cannot distinguish between benignware and malware we evaluate the idelity of malware detection using hpcs we perform quantitative analysis using principal component analysis (pca) to systematically select micro-architectural events that have the most predictive powers we then run programs benignware and malware on our experimental setups we achieve % % % % % and % f-score (a metric of detection rates) of decision tree (dt) random forest (rf) k nearest neighbors (knn) adaboost neural net (nn) and naive bayes respectively we cross-validate our models times to show the distributions of detection rates in various models our cross-validation analysis shows that many of the experiments produce low f-scores the f-score of models in dt rf knn adaboost nn and naive bayes is % % % % % and % respectively to further highlight the incapability of malware detection using hpcs we show that one benignware (notepad ) infused with malware (ransomware) cannot be detected by hpc-based malware detection association for computing machinery 
    one of the main concerns during usage of the current smart mobile devices in public is the vulnerability of password hacking by shoulder-suffering or smudge attack the traditional user authentication techniques such as pin code or patterns-based password are easy target of such attacks in this paper we propose using simple shapes (e g circle triangle etc ) to get users touch behavioral biometrics data the users are asked to draw over these shapes while the developed system extracts different features (e g finger middle stroke and its pressure velocity mobile orientation etc ) for the model training and authentication purpose the proposed solution is simple for all kinds of users and could solve the problem of password hacking through shoulder-suffering or smudge attacks copyright is held by the owner author(s) 
    to maximize the probability of successful attacks and reduce the odds of being detected malware developers implement different versions of the same malicious payloads as a matter of fact malware writers often generate new malicious code starting from existing ones adding small programmed variations or applying obfuscation mechanisms that change the code structure without altering the malicious functionalities for these reasons phylogenetic analysis is becoming of interest as instrument for malware analysts in order to understand the derivation of a malicious payload being thus able to reconduct a derived piece of code to its original known originator in this poster we describe a framework designed to infer and shape the phylogenetic tree of mobile malicious applications the framework considers multi-level features with rule-based machine learning algorithm to retrieve antecedents and descendants of malicious samples association for computing machinery 
    for well over a quarter century detection systems have been driven by models learned from input features collected from real or simulated environments an artifact (e g network event potential malware sample suspicious email) is deemed malicious or non-malicious based on its similarity to the learned model at runtime however the training of the models has been historically limited to only those features available at runtime in this paper we consider an alternate learning approach that trains models using privileged information-features available at training time but not at runtime-to improve the accuracy and resilience of detection systems in particular we adapt and extend recent advances in knowledge transfer model influence and distillation to enable the use of forensic or other data unavailable at runtime in a range of security domains an empirical evaluation shows that privileged information increases precision and recall over a system with no privileged information we observe up to % relative decrease in detection error for fast-flux bot detection % for malware traffic detection % for malware classification and % for face recognition we explore the limitations and applications of different privileged information techniques in detection systems such techniques provide a new means for detection systems to learn from data that would otherwise not be available at runtime association for computing machinery

    this is very true for the windows operating system (os) used by government and private organizations with windows the closed source nature of the operating system has unfortunately meant that hidden security issues are discovered very late and the fixes are not found in real time there needs to be a reexamination of current static methods of malware detection this paper presents an integrated system for automated and real-time monitoring and prediction of rootkit and malware threats for the windows os we propose to host the target windows machines on the widely used xen hypervisor and collect process behavior using virtual memory introspection (vmi) the collected data will be analyzed using state of the art machine learning techniques to quickly isolate malicious process behavior and alert system administrators about potential cyber breaches this research has two focus areas identifying memory data structures and developing prediction tools to detect malware the first part of research focuses on identifying memory data structures affected by malware this includes extracting the kernel data structures with vmi that are frequently targeted by rootkits malware the second part of the research will involve development of a prediction tool using machine learning techniques ieee 
    recently there is an interest in studying cyber crime from a hacker-centric perspective whose insight is to locate key-hackers and use them to find credible threat intelligence however the great majority of users present in hacking environments seem to be unskilled or have fleeting interests making the identification of key-hackers a complex problem moreover as ground truth information is rare in this context there is a lack of a method to validate the results thus previous work neglected this validation step or had it done manually-by hiring qualified security specialists in this work we address the key-hacker identification problem including a systematic method based on reputation to validate the results particularly we study how three different approaches-content social network and seniority-based analysis-perform individually and combined to identify key-hackers on darkweb forums aiming to confirm the following two hypotheses ) a hybridization of these approaches tends to produce better results when compared to the individual ones ) a model conceived to identify key-hackers in one forum can be generalized to other forums that lack a user reputation system or have a deficient one we conduct our experiments using a carefully selected set of features showing how an optimization metaheuristic obtains better performance when compared to machine learning algorithms that attempt to identify key-hackers ieee

    new malicious domain campaigns often include large sets of domains registered in bulk and deployed simultaneously early identification of these campaigns can often be accomplished with distance functions or regular expressions of registered domains but these methods may also miss some campaign domains other studies have used time-of-registration features to help identify malicious domains this paper explores the use of unsupervised clustering based on passive dns records and other inherent network information to identify domains that may be part of campaigns but resistant to detection by domain name or time-of-registration analysis alone we have found that using this method we can achieve up to x expansion from a seed of known campaign domains with less than % false positives this could be a useful tool to augment other methods of identifying malicious domains association for computing machinery 
    in recent years scale frequency and complexity of cyber-attacks have been continuously on the rise as a result it has significantly impacted our daily lives and society as a whole never before have we had such an urgent need to defend against cyber-attacks previous studies suggest that it is possible to detect rootkits and controlflow attacks with high accuracy using information collected from hardware level for data-only exploits however where the controlflowof the victim application is strictly conserved while its behavior may only be slightly modified high accuracy detection is much more difficult to achieve in this study we propose the use of lowlevel hardware information collected as a short time series for the detection of data-only malware attacks we employed several representative classification algorithms e g linear regression (lr) autoencoder (ae) stacked denoising autoencoder (sda) and echo state network (esn) we build one-class classifiers that either use individual samples collected via monitoring hardware-level events or use multiple samples of hardware events collected at different time during execution but all with only the knowledge from regular behavior using several real-life attacks as case studies we examined their detection accuracy when confronted with malicious behavior our experimental results show that our sda- and esnbased approaches can achieve an average detection accuracy of % and % for the exploits studied respectively our study suggests that when the hardware events are monitored at different time spots during the execution of the vulnerable application our sda- and esn-based approaches have the potential to boost the detection accuracy for data exploits association for computing machinery

    behavior-based malware analysis is an important technique for automatically analyzing and detecting malware and it has received considerable attention from both academic and industrial communities by considering how malware behaves we can tackle the malware obfuscation problem which cannot be processed by traditional static analysis approaches and we can also derive the as-built behavior specifications and cover the entire behavior space of the malware samples although there have been several works focusing on malware behavior analysis such research is far from mature and no overviews have been put forward to date to investigate current developments and challenges in this paper we conduct a survey on malware behavior description and analysis considering three aspects malware behavior description behavior analysis methods and visualization techniques first existing behavior data types and emerging techniques for malware behavior description are explored especially the goals principles characteristics and classifications of behavior analysis techniques proposed in the existing approaches second the inadequacies and challenges in malware behavior analysis are summarized from different perspectives finally several possible directions are discussed for future research zhejiang university and springer-verlag gmbh germany part of springer nature 
    damage caused by malware has become a serious problem the recent rise in the spread of evasive malware has made it difficult to detect it at the pre-infection timing malware detection at post-infection timing is a promising approach that fulfills this gap given this background this work aims to identify likely malware-infected devices from the measurement of internet traffic the advantage of the traffic-measurementbased approach is that it enables us to monitor a large number of endhosts if we find an endhost as a source of malicious traffic the endhost is likely a malware-infected device since the majority of malware today makes use of the web as a means to communicate with the c&c servers that reside on the external network we leverage information recorded in the http headers to discriminate between malicious and benign traffic to make our approach scalable and robust we develop the automatic template generation scheme that drastically reduces the amount of information to be kept while achieving the high accuracy of classification since it does not make use of any domain knowledge the approach should be robust against changes of malware we apply several classifiers which include machine learning algorithms to the extracted templates and classify traffic into two categories malicious and benign our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach discriminates between malicious and benign traffic with up to % precision while maintaining the false positive rate below % the institute of electronics information and communication engineers 
    code obfuscation is a staple tool in malware creation where code fragments are altered substantially to make them appear different from the original while keeping the semantics unaffected a majority of the obfuscated code detection methods use program structure as a signature for detection of unknown codes they usually ignore the most important feature which is the semantics of the code to match two code fragments or programs for obfuscation obfuscated code detection is a special case of the semantic code clone detection task we propose a detection framework for detecting both code obfuscation and clone using machine learning we use features extracted from java bytecode dependency graphs (bdg) program dependency graphs (pdg) and abstract syntax trees (ast) bdgs and pdgs are two representations of the semantics or meaning of a java program asts capture the structural aspects of a program we use several publicly available code clone and obfuscated code datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework we use different assessment parameters to evaluate the detection quality of our proposed model experimental results are excellent when compared with contemporary obfuscated code and code clone detectors interestingly we achieve % success in detecting obfuscated code based on recall precision and f-score when we compare our method with other methods for all of obfuscations types viz contraction expansion loop transformation and renaming our model appears to be the winner in case of clone detection our model achieve very high detection accuracy in comparison to other similar detectors elsevier ltd

    reinforcement learning (rl) is a machine learning technique that has been increasingly used in robotic systems in reinforcement learning instead of manually pre-program what action to take at each step we convey the goal a software agent in terms of reward functions the agent tries different actions in order to maximize a numerical value i e the reward a misspecified reward function can cause problems such as reward hacking where the agent finds out ways that maximize the reward without achieving the intended goal as rl agents become more general and autonomous the design of reward functions that elicit the desired behaviour in the agent becomes more important and cumbersome in this paper we present a technique to formally express reward functions in a structured way this stimulates a proper reward function design and as well enables the formal verification of it we start by defining the reward function using state machines in this way we can statically check that the reward function satisfies certain properties e g high-level requirements of the function to learn later we automatically generate a runtime monitor - which runs in parallel with the learning agent - that provides the rewards according to the definition of the state machine and based on the behaviour of the agent we use the uppaal model checker to design the reward model and verify the tctl properties that model high-level requirements of the reward function and larva to monitor and enforce the reward model to the rl agent at runtime ieee

    in recent years the number and variety of malicious mobile apps have increased drastically especially on android platform which brings insurmountable challenges for malicious app detection researchers endeavor to discover the traces of malicious apps using network traffic analysis in this study we combine network traffic analysis with machine learning methods to identify malicious network behavior and eventually to detect malicious apps however most network traffic generated by malicious apps is benign while only a small portion of traffic is malicious leading to an imbalanced data problem when the traffic model skews towards modeling the benign traffic to address this problem we introduce imbalanced classification methods including the synthetic minority oversampling technique (smote) support vector machine (svm) svm cost-sensitive (svmcs) and c cost-sensitive (c cs) methods however when the imbalance rate reaches a certain threshold the performance of common imbalanced classification algorithms degrades significantly to avoid performance degradation we propose to use the imbalanced data gravitation-based classification (idgc) algorithm to classify imbalanced data moreover we develop a simplex imbalanced data gravitation classification (s-idgc) model to further reduce the time costs of idgc without sacrificing the classification performance in addition we propose a machine learning based comparative benchmark prototype system which provides users with substantial autonomy such as multiple choices of the desired classifiers or traffic features using this prototype system users can compare the detection performance of different classification algorithms on the same data set as well as the performance of a specific classification algorithm on multiple data sets

    this paper presents a cyber-defense system named the active malware countermeasure system aimed at maintaining the operation of mission-critical systems by mitigating damage after compromise has occurred this system is designed to implement techniques that will nullify the effect of malicious actions taken against mission-critical systems diverting identified malicious functionality away from the mission-critical system to sacrificial virtual machine(s) (vm) effectively nullifies malware the proposed system utilizes hooking techniques to intercept malicious operations before they execute in the critical environment the hooks are then used to facilitate diversion of malicious functions to a vm virtualization is used to create a safe isolated environment where the malicious functionality can be executed without affecting the critical environment return values and information associated with the function execution can then be sent back to the malicious process so its execution can proceed as normal the maintained execution of malware in this hooked state allows the mission-critical system to continue operating as damaging functionality is diverted to the safe environment minimizing down-time of critical operations despite compromise ieee

    to relieve increasingly prominent security issues of android applications static malware-detection techniques have become essential due to their rapid and convenient detection processes which do not require running the detected applications most of current commercial anti-malware tools utilize signatures of known malicious android codes for static detection but are unable to find out unknown especially newly created malware many existing malware-detection researches rely on traditional machine learning techniques to analyze some static features of android applications such as permissions and api calls but the detection approaches still have room for improvement with respect to simplicity effectiveness or efficiency to overcome the limitations of the above detection techniques we propose a novel static approach to detect malicious android applications by proposing a set of android program features consisting of sensitive permissions and sensitive api calls and by utilizing extreme learning machine we implemented our approach with an automated testing tool called waffledetector controlled experiments have been conducted to compare our approach and the existing ones on detecting malicious android applications and the results show that our approach excels the existing ones with minimal human intervention better detection effectiveness and less detection time ieee

    in this paper we present an unconventional anti ics-malware approach we leverage a factor that appears to be overlooked as of this writing namely that ics malware often infect machines which do not run any functions related to industrial process control these may be for example business machines in the enterprise networks of power utility companies or even random machines on the internet because ics environments use special-purpose communication protocols it is highly unlikely that any application code on those machines will send or receive network traffic through an ics communication protocol on the other hand ics malware discover their targets via searches that initiate ics communication protocol traffic our approach uses a kernel filter driver to analyze the network traffic that flows through a real nic the kernel filter driver works with a module that uses in-kernel ics protocol signatures to recognize ics protocol traffic embedded within the network traffic in question our approach can detect -day malware on machines that are unrelated to industrial process control without any prior knowledge of their internal code and data we performed extensive testing against malware samples involved in recent cyber attack campaigns as well as safety and efficiency tests and thus discuss the findings in the paper ieee 
    recent cyber attack campaigns such as those supported by the blackenergy and dragonfly malware have targeted protective relays over the network protective relays are the ultimate attack target as they interface directly with physical lines and equipment in electrical substations a compromised relay allows the attacker to operate circuit breakers and thus disrupt the transmission and distribution of power malware that implement control theoretical models can cause and also maximize physical permanent damage to the power equipment we present a defensive deception approach that operates on the protective relays of an electrical substation we use kernel drivers on a protective relay to create dynamic decoys which consist of emulated i o boards and their hardware controllers a phantom i o board is operated in conjunction with closely monitored memory buffers that are accessible in user space we store in those buffers dynamic decoy data associated with the phantom substation equipment and processes that the phantom i o board appears to interface with those data are generated and stored as per the iec protocol and can be retrieved over the mms and opc protocols our approach mimics a protective relay's interaction with segments of the electrical substation which in fact are all decoys our approach can detect -day malware on protective relays in production without any prior knowledge of their internal code and data we performed practical validations against malware samples involved in recent cyber attack campaigns and discuss the findings in the paper ieee 
    webcams are commonly used by advanced malware to spy on computer users victims are silently filmed without their knowledge for extended periods of time recent attack trends show that webcam video covertly recorded by malware is used beyond the boundaries of the cyber domain and thus is combined with human factors the delilah malware for example lurks on a compromised machine while using the webcam to capture details about family work social connections and any other element involved in the life of a target user the attackers then blackmail the target user with the goal of turning him her into an insider threat to his her employer the attackers ask the victim to give them industrial secrets in return for not disclosing video that is highly sensitive to him her in this paper we discuss an approach that enables the defender to sustain prolonged interaction with attackers for defensive and forensics purposes the approach uses a decoy webcam on machines in production it relies on a decoy video traffic injector module as well as on the learning of the operational dynamics of real webcams a webcam shadowing mechanism alternates between the real webcam and the decoy webcam that mechanism causes malware to target the decoy webcam but still enables the user to only see and hence use the real webcam the approach can feed decoy webcam traffic into the data stream that malware intercept and send to attackers the decoy webcam is robust to probes and is able to coexist with production functions ieee

    the evolution of mobile malware poses a serious threat to smartphone security today sophisticated attackers can adapt by maximally sabotaging machine-learning classifiers via polluting training data rendering most recent machine learning-based malware detection tools (such as drebin droidapiminer and mamadroid) ineffective in this paper we explore the feasibility of constructing crafted malware samples examine how machine-learning classifiers can be misled under three different threat models then conclude that injecting carefully crafted data into training data can significantly reduce detection accuracy to tackle the problem we propose kuafudet a two-phase learning enhancing approach that learns mobile malware by adversarial detection kuafudet includes an offline training phase that selects and extracts features from the training set and an online detection phase that utilizes the classifier trained by the first phase to further address the adversarial environment these two phases are intertwined through a self-adaptive learning scheme wherein an automated camouflage detector is introduced to filter the suspicious false negatives and feed them back into the training phase we finally show that kuafudet can significantly reduce false negatives and boost the detection accuracy by at least % experiments on more than mobile applications demonstrate that kuafudet is scalable and can be highly effective as a standalone system elsevier ltd
    this paper examines how canadian constituency campaigns perceive and use data in elections we apply a conceptual framework for data-driven campaigning developed from existing literature to participant observations and interview responses from the conservative liberal and ndp campaigns in a single riding during the general election of the rhetoric of big data notwithstanding we find significant variation in the extent and nature of the use of data at the constituency level and that the increasing use of data in electioneering may have a centralizing effect on traditionally stratarchical political party organization canadian political science 
    in this article we report the results of a study that tested a values-based method of predicting political election results the study was carried out on the new zealand general election randomly selecting a stratified sample from a consumer panel the survey of participants used open-ended questions to invoke and capture values relevant to the election by using corpus linguistic analysis techniques terms were ranked by weighting based on a log-frequency entropy method lexicons for lasswell and kaplans societal value framework reduced the corpus of term-weighted documents to a workable number of eight user-defined societal value-topics the topics were regressed onto the individual voting decision using a multinomial logit (mnl) regression the mean absolute deviation (mad) from the actual vote was % much less than the margin of error of % expected from sampling error alone the methodology was successful in predicting the outcome for the minor parties with good accuracy for example the prediction for the then newly formed internet-mana was out by about % the framing-balanced valuebased predictions exhibited reasonable stability considering they were made six weeks before election day thus the values relevant to the voters and a good prediction of the voting behavior became evident ahead of the official campaign period which started four weeks before election day in new zealand our study concluded that the value-based prediction shows promise for improving the quality of political journalism and public engagement in the period of election campaigns and will assist greatly in focusing public debate more on values that are influential on citizens voting decisions the author(s) 
    the widespread of mobile applications has led to increase smartphone malware detecting malware requires extracting features to determine the malware apps from non-malware apps to understand malware apps' features we need a better understanding of the requested permissions in manifest file of apk file in this paper we present our framework based on extracting apk's permissions with the aims to detect the malware upon granted permissions in mobile app the permissions keywords are extracted from the manifest file of apk file using virustotal website these collected applications and their permissions keywords will go through pre-data analytics process before being trained to various machine learning classifiers we collected around apps from google play as non-malware apps and malicious apps from different sources such as proguard contagio mobile blog and the drebin dataset the permissions keywords of the collected apk are extracted and saved to build final dataset that contains samples of benign and malignant applications with the final collections of permissions keywords finally the dataset is fed to machine learning by utilizing several classifiers such as naivebayes sequential minimal optimization (smo) decision table zeror and decision trees (j and random forests the results show that sequential minimal optimization (smo) classifier achieved high performance in the detection rate of the classifier with an acceptable accuracy of % international center for scientific research and studies

    in this article we use machine activity metrics to automatically distinguish between malicious and trusted portable executable software samples the motivation stems from the growth of cyber attacks using techniques that have been employed to surreptitiously deploy advanced persistent threats (apts) apts are becoming more sophisticated and able to obfuscate much of their identifiable features through encryption custom code bases and in-memory execution our hypothesis is that we can produce a high degree of accuracy in distinguishing malicious from trusted samples using machine learning with features derived from the inescapable footprint left behind on a computer system during execution this includes cpu ram swap use and network traffic at a count level of bytes and packets these features are continuous and allow us to be more flexible with the classification of samples than discrete features such as api calls (which can also be obfuscated) that form the main feature of the extant literature we use these continuous data and develop a novel classification method using self organizing feature maps to reduce over fitting during training through the ability to create unsupervised clusters of similar behaviour that are subsequently used as features for classification rather than using the raw data we compare our method to a set of machine classification methods that have been applied in previous research and demonstrate an increase of between % and % in classification accuracy using our method and an unseen dataset over the range of other machine classification methods that have been applied in previous research the authors

    phishing is an online identity theft in which an attacker tries to steal user's personal information resulting in financial loss of individuals as well as organisations nowadays mobile devices especially smartphones are increasingly being used by the users due to a wide range of functionalities they provide these devices are very compact and provide functionalities similar to those of desktop computers due to which attackers are now targeting the mobile device users however detection of mobile phishing attack is a different problem from desktop phishing due to the dissimilar architectures of both moreover identification of mobile phishing attack with high accuracy is an important research issue as not much amount of work has been done in this field many anti-phishing solutions for mobile devices have been proposed till date but still there is a lack of a full fledge solution the primary objective of this paper is to do a detailed analysis on mobile phishing attacking techniques and defence mechanisms we present this paper in four folds first we discuss in detail about mobile phishing attack its history motivation of attackers and security concerns of smartphones second we analyse various mobile phishing attacks and provide a taxonomy of the same third we provide taxonomy of numerous recently proposed solutions that detect and defend users from mobile phishing attacks fourth we discuss different issues and challenges faced by researchers while dealing with mobile phishing attacks in addition we have also discussed datasets and evaluation matrices used by researchers for evaluating their approaches elsevier ltd
    network and internet security is a critical universal issue the increased rate of cyber terrorism has put national security under risk in addition internet attacks have caused severe damages to different sectors (i e individuals economy enterprises organizations and governments) network intrusion detection systems (nids) are one of the solutions against these attacks however nids always need to improve their performance in terms of increasing the accuracy and decreasing false alarms integrating feature selection with intrusion detection has shown to be a successful approach since feature selection can help in selecting the most informative features from the entire set of features usually for the stealthy and low profile attacks (zero day attacks) there are few neatly concealed packets distributed over a long period of time to mislead firewalls and nids besides there are many features extracted from those packets which may make some machine learning-based feature selection methods to suffer from overfitting especially when the data have large numbers of features and relatively small numbers of examples in this paper we are proposing a nids based on a feature selection method called recursive feature addition (rfa) and bigram technique the system has been designed implemented and tested we tested the model on the iscx data set which is one of the most well-known and recent data sets for intrusion detection purposes furthermore we are proposing a bigram technique to encode payload string features into a useful representation that can be used in feature selection in addition we propose a new evaluation metric called (combined) that combines accuracy detection rate and false alarm rate in a way that helps in comparing different systems and selecting the best among them the designed feature selection-based system has shown a noticeable improvement on the performance using different metrics elsevier ltd
    social media are becoming an increasingly important source of information about the public mood regarding issues such as elections brexit stock market etc in this paper we focus on sentiment classification of twitter data construction of sentiment classifiers is a standard text mining task but here we address the question of how to properly evaluate them as there is no settled way to do so sentiment classes are ordered and unbalanced and twitter produces a stream of time-ordered data the problem we address concerns the procedures used to obtain reliable estimates of performance measures and whether the temporal ordering of the training and test data matters we collected a large set of million tweets in european languages we created sentiment models and out-of-sample datasets which are used as a gold standard for evaluations the corresponding in-sample data-sets are used to empirically compare six different estimation procedures three variants of cross-validation and three variants of sequential validation (where test set always follows the training set) we find no significant difference between the best cross-validation and sequential validation however we observe that all cross-validation variants tend to overestimate the performance while the sequential methods tend to underestimate it standard cross-validation with random selection of examples is significantly worse than the blocked cross-validation and should not be used to evaluate classifiers in time-ordered data scenarios mozeti et al this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original author and source are credited 
    research into the nature and structure of dark webs such as tor has largely focused upon manually labelling a series of crawled sites against a series of categories sometimes using these labels as a training corpus for subsequent automated crawls such an approach is adequate for establishing broad taxonomies but is of limited value for specialised tasks within the field of law enforcement contrastingly existing research into illicit behaviour online has tended to focus upon particular crime types such as terrorism a gap exists between taxonomies capable of holistic representation and those capable of detailing criminal behaviour the absence of such a taxonomy limits interoperability between agencies curtailing development of standardised classification tools we introduce the tor-use motivation model (tmm) a two-dimensional classification methodology specifically designed for use within a law enforcement context the tmm achieves greater levels of granularity by explicitly distinguishing site content from motivation providing a richer labelling schema without introducing inefficient complexity or reliance upon overly broad categories of relevance we demonstrate this flexibility and robustness through direct examples showing the tmm's ability to distinguish a range of unethical and illegal behaviour without bloating the model with unnecessary detail the authors of this paper received permission from the australian government to conduct an unrestricted crawl of tor for research purposes including the gathering and analysis of illegal materials such as child pornography the crawl gathered pages from tor virtual domains resulting in the collation of a wide spectrum of materials from illicit to downright banal existing conceptual models and their labelling schemas were tested against a small sample of gathered data and were observed to be either overly prescriptive or vague for law enforcement purposes - particularly when used for prioritising sites of interest for further investigation in this paper we deploy the tmm by manually labelling a corpus of over unique tor pages we found a network impacted (but not dominated) by illicit commerce and money laundering but almost completely devoid of violence and extremism in short criminality on this dark web is based more upon greed and desire rather than any particular political motivations elsevier ltd

    cyber attacks against sensitive data have become as serious threats all over the world due to the rising applications of computer and information technology new malware or malicious programs are released everyday by cyber criminals through the internet in an attempt to steal or destroy important data hence research on protecting data receives tremendous interest in the cyber community in order to cope with new variants of malicious software machine learning techniques can be used for accurate classification and detection this paper proposes an efficient scheme for malware detection for protecting sensitive data from malicious threats using data mining and machine learning techniques experimental results shows that the proposed approach gives better performance compared to other similar methods ieee 
    the extensive use and rapid growth in popularity of android phones have attracted the malware developer's attention due to this reason malware attacks on android devices are increasing every year in this research firstly we have investigated existing anti-malware techniques and identified their limitations secondly we provided the description of a novel -level hybrid malware detection model for android operating systems which is an open-ended project and is currently under development it is designed to ensure accurate detection of malware through the combination of i) static & dynamic analysis ii) local & remote host and iii) machine learning intelligence through experimental results it is shown that the -level hybrid malware detection model can achieve % detection rate which is higher in comparison to the detection rate of drebin ieee 
    computer-based automatically generated text is used in various applications (e g text summarization machine translation) and has come to play an important role in daily life however computer-generated text may produce confusing information due to translation errors and inappropriate wording caused by faulty language processing which could be a critical issue in presidential elections and product advertisements previous methods for detecting computer-generated text typically estimate text fluency but this may not be useful in the near future due to the development of neural-network-based natural language generation that produces wording close to human-crafted wording a different approach to detecting computergenerated text is thus needed we hypothesize that human-crafted wording is more consistent than that of a computer for instance zipf's law states that the most frequent word in human-written text has approximately twice the frequency of the second most frequent word nearly three times that of the third most frequent word and so on we found that this is not true in the case of computer-generated text we hence propose a method to identify computer-generated text on the basis of statistics first the word distribution frequencies are compared with the corresponding zipfian distributions to extract the frequency features next complex phrase features are extracted because human-generated text contains more complex phrases than computer-generated text finally the higher consistency of the human-generated text is quantified at both the sentence level using phrasal verbs and at the paragraph level using coreference resolution relationships which are integrated into consistency features the combination of the frequencies the complex phrases and the consistency features was evaluated for english books written originally in english and english books translated from finnish the results show that our method achieves better performance (accuracy = % equal error rate = %) compared with the most suitable method for books using parsing tree feature extraction evaluation using two other languages (french and dutch) showed similar results the proposed method thus works consistently in various languages ieee 
    ransomware is one of the most increasing malwares used by cyber-criminals in recent days this type of malware uses cryptographic technology that encrypts a user's important files folders makes the computer systems unusable holds the decryption key and asks for the ransom from the victims for recovery the recent ransomware families are very sophisticated and difficult to analyze & detect using static features only on the other hand latest crypto-ransomwares having sandboxing and ids evading capabilities so obviously static or dynamic analysis of the ransomware alone cannot provide better solution in this paper we will present a machine learning based approach which will use integrated method a combination of static and dynamic analysis to detect ransomware the experimental test samples were taken from almost all ransomware families including the most recent 'wannacry' the results also suggest that combined analysis can detect ransomware with better accuracy compared to individual analysis approach since ransomware samples show some 'run-time' and 'static code' features it also helps for the early detection of new and similar ransomware variants ieee 
    in this paper the online optimal cyber-defense problem has been investigated for cyber-physical systems (cps) with unknown cyber-attacks firstly a novel cyber state dynamics has been generated that can evaluate the real-time impacts from current cyber-attack and defense strategies effectively and dynamically next adopting game theory technique the idea optimal defense design can be obtained by using the full knowledge of cyber-state dynamics to relax the requirement about cyber-state dynamics a game-theoretical actor-critic neural network (nn) structure was developed to efficiently learn the optimal cyber defense strategy online moreover to further improve the practicality of developed scheme a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm have been designed and implemented into actor-critic nn structure eventually the numerical simulation demonstrate that proposed deep reinforcement learning based optimal defense strategy cannot only online defend the cps even in presence of unknown cyber-attacks and also learn the optimal defense policy more accurate and timely ieee 
    modern malware represents an emerging threat not only to individual privacy but also to organizational security over the last few decades a number of malware families have been codified differentiated by their behaviour and functionality the majority of machine learning methods work well with the general benign-malicious classification yet fail to distinguish among many classes deep learning is known to be successful for such applications deep neural networks in particular there is no way however to extract an understandable model in order to characterize each malware family separately thus the goal of this paper is many-fold we investigated multinomial malware categorization using static and dynamic behavioural features extracted from windows portable executables (pe) malware collection as of the end of furthermore we proposed a novel deep neuro-fuzzy architecture a hybrid intelligence approach capable of boosting the performance of conventional neuro-fuzzy method targeting rules extraction it proved capable of achieving a % better result than classical neuro-fuzzy and % improvement over the same complexity deep neural network (dnn) moreover we studied the deep neural network behaviour when handling such non-trivial problems as multinomial malware categorization we believe that this model contributes to windows pe malware categorization by improving the similarity-based detection of zero-days malware it can serve as a stepping stone for malware analysts to speed up the detection and dissemination ieee 
    sunni extremism poses a significant danger to society yet it is relatively easy for these extremist organizations to spread jihadist propaganda and recruit new members via the internet darknet and social media the sheer volume of these sites make them very difficult to police this paper discusses an approach that can assist with this problem by automatically identifying a subset of web pages and social media content (or any text) that contains extremist content the approach utilizes machine learning specifically neural networks and deep learning to classify text as containing 'extremist' or 'benign' (i e not extremist) content this method is robust and can effectively learn to classify extremist multilingual text of varying length this study also involved the construction of a high quality dataset for training and testing put together by a team of people (some with fluency in arabic) who expended hours of combined effort this dataset should facilitate future research on this topic ieee

    anti-virus vendors receive hundreds of thousands of malware to be analysed each day some are new malware while others are variations or evolutions of existing malware because analyzing each malware sample by hand is impossible automated techniques to analyse and categorize incoming samples are needed in this work we explore various machine learning features extracted from malware samples through static analysis for classification of malware binaries into already known malware families we present a new feature based on control statement shingling that has a comparable accuracy to ordinary opcode n-gram based features while requiring smaller dimensions this in turn results in a shorter training time ieee

    differential evolution (de) is a population-based algorithm which has been successfully used to solve optimization problems de algorithm begins with an initial population with some randomly generated candidate solutions during evolutionary process the population of candidate solutions is evolved toward the promising region by using the specific operations the population in the de algorithm can resemble an especial perspective of a small society which has individuals to seek a common goal in a society the election system is commonly used as an effective approach which is employed to determine one or several representatives who are responsible to make major decisions some machine learning algorithms are inspired from the society election system to develop an enhanced algorithm from a pool of potential algorithms with the complementary performances this study is motivated from the election systems of societies which can be applied on population-based algorithms here de algorithm as a case study we propose an election-based discrete de algorithm which uses the information of all candidate solutions to create a new trial solution as a president candidate solution during optimization phases after applying the evolutionary operators all candidate solutions vote to select the values of president's variables in the proposed method a majority voting method is applied to choose a value for each variable of the president candidate solution we employ the discrete de (dde) algorithm as the parent algorithm to develop election-based discrete de (edde) which is evaluated on the fifteen discrete benchmark functions simulation results confirm that edde obtains a promising performance on the majority of these functions ieee 
    ransomware attacks are becoming prevalent nowadays with the flourishing of crypto-currencies as the most harmful variant of ransomware crypto-ransomware encrypts the victim's valuable data and asks for ransom money paying the ransom money however may not guarantee recovery of the data being encrypted most of the existing work for ransomware defense purely focuses on ransomware detection a few of them consider data recovery from ransomware attacks but they are not able to defend against ransomware which can obtain a high system privilege in this work we design rds a novel ransomware defense strategy in which we stealthily back up data in the spare space of a computing device such that the data encrypted by ransomware can be restored our key idea is that the spare space which stores the backup data is fully isolated from the ransomware in this way the ransomware is not able to 'touch' the backup data regardless of what privilege it can obtain security analysis and experimental evaluation show that rds can mitigate ransomware attacks with an acceptable overhead ieee 
    internet revolution has brought advancement to the worlds economy business technology and communication it also brings forth the risk of cyber-attack penetration it is a challenge to detect cyber-attack accurately and timely in this work we adopted a large network dataset containing malware attack data and trained it to recognize a cyber security attack to establish an expert system the characteristics of attackers ip addresses can be extracted from our integrated dataset for statistical data extraction the cyber security expert annotates the weight of each attribute and constructs a scoring system through log history annotation we adopted a special semi supervise method to classify cyber security log into attack unsure and no attack by first splitting the data into clusters using fuzzy k-means (fkm) then manually label a small data (analyst intuition) and finally train the neural network classifier multi-layer perceptron (mlp) based on the manually labelled data by doing so our results were more encouraging as compared to finding anomalies within cyber security logs without analyst intuitions labelling the latter generally creates a large amount of false detections icic international 
    the use of machine learning algorithms for cyber security purposes gives rise to questions of adversarial resilience namely can we quantify the effort required of an adversary to manipulate a system that is based on machine learning techniques? can the adversarial resilience of such systems be formally modeled and evaluated? can we quantify this resilience such that different systems can be compared using empiric metrics? past works have demonstrated how an adversary can manipulate a system based on machine learning techniques by changing some of its inputs however comparatively little work has emphasized the creation of a formal method for measuring and comparing the adversarial resilience of different machine learning models to these changes in this work we study the adversarial resilience of detection systems based on supervised machine learning models we provide a formal definition for adversarial resilience while focusing on multisensory fusion systems we define the model robustness (mrb) score a metric for evaluating the relative resilience of different models and suggest two novel feature selection algorithms for constructing adversary aware classifiers the first algorithm selects only features that cannot realistically be modified by the adversary while the second algorithm allows control over the resilience versus accuracy tradeoff finally we evaluate our approach with a real-life use case of dynamic malware classification using an extensive up-to-date corpus of benign and malware executables we demonstrate the potential of using adversary aware feature selection for building more resilient classifiers and provide empirical evidence supporting the inherent resilience of ensemble algorithms compared to single model algorithms elsevier ltd
    an intrusion detection system (ids) is primarily used to protect nuclear power plants from external threats such as sabotage and malicious attacks however earlier versions of idss are configured to detect an intrusion from visual inspection by an operator this has the disadvantages of requiring standby human resources and relying on operator capabilities in this paper therefore we propose an image-based intelligent intrusion detection system (iids) with a virtual fence active intruder detection classification and tracking and motion recognition to solve these limitations an integrated acquisition device was manufactured combining optical and thermal cameras to compensate for the disadvantages of optical cameras which have difficulty detecting an intrusion at night under adverse weather conditions and when the intruder is camouflaged the virtual fence has a function to set the boundary between surveillance and external areas in a graphical user interface and to define an early pre-alarm area if necessary the background model is designed to detect moving objects and detected objects are segmented into bounding boxes we implemented a network model based on a convolutional neural network (cnn) to classify moving objects as either intruders or wild animals if an intruder is detected in real time and is crossing the virtual fence the alarm tile blinks with the associated color five types of intruder behavior patterns are recognized by optimizing a long-term recurrent convolutional network (lrcn) model the proposed iids meets the physical protection requirements recommended in the nuclear regulatory guidelines and can be used as an unmanned surveillance system it is expected to perform more active and reliable intrusion detection in combination with existing sensors such as microwaves electric fields and fence disturbance sensors in a nuclear power plant elsevier ltd
    the increase in the number and diversity of smart objects has raised substantial cybersecurity challenges due to the recent exponential rise in the occurrence and sophistication of attacks although cloud computing has transformed the world of business in a dramatic way its centralization hammers the application of distributed services such as security mechanisms for iot applications the new and emerging iot applications require novel cybersecurity controls models and decisions distributed at the edge of the network despite the success of the existing cryptographic solutions in the traditional internet factors such as system development flaws increased attack surfaces and hacking skills have proven the inevitability of detection mechanisms the traditional approaches such as classical machine-learning-based attack detection mechanisms have been successful in the last decades but it has already been proven that they have low accuracy and less scalability for cyber-attack detection in massively distributed nodes such as iot the proliferation of deep learning and hardware technology advancement could pave a way to detecting the current level of sophistication of cyber-attacks in edge networks the application of deep networks has already been successful in big data areas and this indicates that fog-tothings computing can be the ultimate beneficiary of the approach for attack detection because a massive amount of data produced by iot devices enable deep models to learn better than shallow algorithms in this article we propose a novel distributed deep learning scheme of cyber-attack detection in fog-to-things computing our experiments show that deep models are superior to shallow models in detection accuracy false alarm rate and scalability ieee 
    in order to fulfill the requirements like stringent timing restraints and demand on resources cyberphysical system (cps) must deploy on the virtualized environment such as cloud computing to protect virtual machines (vms) in which cpss are functioning against malware-based attacks malware detection and mitigation technique is emerging as a highly crucial concern the traditional vm-based anti-malware software themselves a potential target for malware-based attack since they are easily subverted by sophisticated malware thus a reliable and robust malware monitoring and detection systems are needed to detect and mitigate rapidly the malware based cyber-attacks in real time particularly for virtualized environment the virtual machine introspection (vmi) has emerged as a fine-grained out-of-vm security solution to detect malware by introspecting and reconstructing the volatile memory state of the live guest operating system (os) by functioning at the virtual machine monitor (vmm) or hypervisor however the reconstructed semantic details by the vmi are available in a combination of benign and malicious states at the hypervisor in order to distinguish between these two states extensive manual analysis is required by the existing out-of-vm security solutions to address the foremost issue in this paper we propose an advanced vmm-based guest-assisted automated multilevel malware detection system (ammds) that leverages both vmi and memory forensic analysis (mfa) techniques to predict early symptoms of malware execution by detecting stealthy hidden processes on a live guest os more specifically the ammds system detects and classifies the actual running malicious executables from the semantically reconstructed process view of the guest os the two sub-components of the ammds are online malware detector (omd) and offline malware classifier (ofmc) the omd recognizes whether the running processes are benign or malicious using its local malware signature database (lmsd) and online malware scanner and the ofmc classify unknown malware by adopting machine learning techniques at the hypervisor the ammds has been evaluated by executing large real-world malware and benign executables on to the live guest oss the evaluation results achieved % of accuracy and zero false positive rate (fpr) on the -fold cross-validation in classifying unknown malware with maximum performance overhead of % elsevier b v

    malware classification using machine learning algorithms is a difficult task in part due to the absence of strong natural features in raw executable binary files byte n-grams previously have been used as features but little work has been done to explain their performance or to understand what concepts are actually being learned in contrast to other work using n-gram features in this work we use orders of magnitude more data and we perform feature selection during model building using elastic-net regularized logistic regression we compute a regularization path and analyze novel multi-byte identifiers through this process we discover significant previously unreported issues with byte n-gram features that cause their benefits and practicality to be overestimated three primary issues emerged from our work first we discovered a flaw in how previous corpora were created that leads to an over-estimation of classification accuracy second we discovered that most of the information contained in n-grams stem from string features that could be obtained in simpler ways finally we demonstrate that n-gram features promote overfitting even with linear models and extreme regularization springer-verlag france (outside the usa) 
    despite the increasing use of social media platforms for information and news gathering its unmoderated nature often leads to the emergence and spread of rumours i e items of information that are unverified at the time of posting at the same time the openness of social media platforms provides opportunities to study how users share and discuss rumours and to explore how to automatically assess their veracity using natural language processing and data mining techniques in this article we introduce and discuss two types of rumours that circulate on social media long-standing rumours that circulate for long periods of time and newly emerging rumours spawned during fast-paced events such as breaking news where reports are released piecemeal and often with an unverified status in their early stages we provide an overview of research into social media rumours with the ultimate goal of developing a rumour classification system that consists of four components rumour detection rumour tracking rumour stance classification and rumour veracity classification we delve into the approaches presented in the scientific literature for the development of each of these four components we summarise the efforts and achievements so far toward the development of rumour classification systems and conclude with suggestions for avenues for future research in social media mining for the detection and resolution of rumours acm

    in recent elections campaigns have based their contact decisions on individual microtargeted propensity scores generated using big data rather than the more traditional geographic-based contacting shifts in campaign strategy have implications for who is contacted and ultimately who participates in elections as campaigns focus more of their outreach towards individuals who the data indicate are more likely to turn out and more likely to vote for their candidate some groups may be systematically excluded from contact we investigate this using voter files and survey data from the us elections to compare who the republicans identified for campaign contact using microtargeted propensity scores and who would have been identified for contact if they used a strictly geographic-based approach our findings suggest that young people are much less likely to be designated for contact when campaigns rely on microtargeted data than older individuals the latter of whom are more likely to be contacted under both geographic and microtargeting strategies elections public opinion & parties

    deep neural networks (dnns) provide excellent performance across a wide range of classification tasks but their training requires high computational resources and is often outsourced to third parties recent work has shown that outsourced training introduces the risk that a malicious trainer will return a backdoored dnn that behaves normally on most inputs but causes targeted misclassifications or degrades the accuracy of the network when a trigger known only to the attacker is present in this paper we provide the first effective defenses against backdoor attacks on dnns we implement three backdoor attacks from prior work and use them to investigate two promising defenses pruning and fine-tuning we show that neither by itself is sufficient to defend against sophisticated attackers we then evaluate fine-pruning a combination of pruning and fine-tuning and show that it successfully weakens or even eliminates the backdoors i e in some cases reducing the attack success rate to % with only a % drop in accuracy for clean (non-triggering) inputs our work provides the first step toward defenses against backdoor attacks in deep neural networks springer nature switzerland ag 
    modern intrusion detection systems struggle to detect advanced custom attacks against most vectors from web application injections to malware reverse connections with encrypted traffic current solutions mostly utilize complex patterns or behavioral analytics on software user actions and services historical data together with traffic analysis in an effort to detect specific types of attacks still false positives and negatives plague such systems behavioral-based security solutions provides good results but need large amounts of time and data to train (often spanning months or even years of surveillance) - especially when encryption comes into play in this paper we present a network traffic monitoring system that implements a detection method using machine learning over side channel characteristics of tcp ip packets and not deep packet inspection user analytics or binary analysis we were able to efficiently distinguish normal from malicious traffic over a wide range of attacks with a true positive detection rate of about % few similar efforts have been made for the classification of malicious traffic but existing methods rely on complex feature selection and deep packet analysis to achieve similar (or worse) detection rates most focus on encrypted malware traffic we manage to distinguish malicious from normal traffic in a wide range of different types of attacks (e g unencrypted and encrypted malware traffic and or shellcode connections website defacing attacks ransomware downloaded cryptolocker attacks etc ) using only few side channel packet characteristics and we achieve similar or better overall detection rates from similar detection systems we compare seven different machine learning algorithms on multiple traffic sets to produce the best possible results we use less features than other proposed solutions and thus require less data and achieve short times during training and classification springer nature switzerland ag

    in the midst of today's pervasive influence of social media automatically detecting fake news is drawing significant attention from both the academic communities and the general public existing detection approaches rely on machine learning algorithms with a variety of news characteristics to detect fake news however such approaches have a major limitation on detecting fake news early i e the information required for detecting fake news is often unavailable or inadequate at the early stage of news propagation as a result the accuracy of early detection of fake news is low to address this limitation in this paper we propose a novel model for early detection of fake news on social media through classifying news propagation paths we first model the propagation path of each news story as a multivariate time series in which each tuple is a numerical vector representing characteristics of a user who engaged in spreading the news then we build a time series classifier that incorporates both recurrent and convolutional networks which capture the global and local variations of user characteristics along the propagation path respectively to detect fake news experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can detect fake news with accuracy % and % on twitter and sina weibo respectively in minutes after it starts to spread which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art baselines copyright association for the advancement of artificial intelligence ( ) all rights reserved

    this paper highlights how machine learning can help explain terrorism we note that even though machine learning has a reputation for black box prediction in fact it can provide deeply nuanced explanations of terrorism moreover machine learning is not sensitive to the sometimes heroic statistical assumptions necessary when parametric econometrics is applied to the study of terrorism this increases the reliability of explanations while adding contextual nuance that captures the flavor of individualized case analysis nevertheless this approach also gives us a sense of the replicability of results we therefore suggest that it further expands the role of science in terrorism research walter de gruyter gmbh

    pattern recognition is an essential part of modern security systems for malware detection intrusion detection and spam filtering conventional classifiers widely used in these applications are found vulnerable themselves to adversarial machine learning attacks existing studies argued that ensemble classifiers are more robust than a single classifier under evasion attacks due to more uniform weights produced on the basis of training data in this paper we investigate the problem in a more practical setting where attackers do not know the classifier details instead attackers may acquire only a portion of the labeled data or a replacement dataset for learning the target decision boundary in this case we show that ensemble classifiers are not necessarily more robust under a least effort attack based on gradient descent our experiments are conducted with both linear and kernel svms on real datasets for spam filtering and malware detection springer nature switzerland ag

    machine learning-based malware detection systems have been widely suggested and used as a replacement for signature-based detection methods such systems have shown that they can provide a high detection rate when recognising non-previously seen malware samples however when classifying malware based on their behavioural features some new malware can go undetected resulting in a misclassification our aim is to gain more understanding of the underlying causes of malware misclassification this will help to develop more robust malware detection systems towards this objective several questions have been addressed in this paper does misclassification increase over a period of time? do changes that affect classification occur in malware at the level of families where all instances that belong to certain families are hard to detect? alternatively can such changes be traced back to certain malware variants instead of families? also does misclassification increase when removing distinct api functions that have been used only by malware? as this technique could be used by malware writers to evade the detection our experiments showed that changes in malware behaviour are mostly due to behavioural changes at the level of variants across malware families where variants did not behave as expected it also showed that machine learning-based systems could maintain a high detection rate even in the case of trying to evade the detection by not using distinct api functions which are uniquely used by malware springer international publishing ag part of springer nature

    android has become the most popular platform for mobile devices and also it has become a popular target for malware developers at the same time researchers have proposed a large number of methods both static and dynamic analysis methods to fight against malwares among these machine learning based methods are quite effective in android malware detection the accuracy of which can be up to % thus malware developers have the incentives to develop more advanced malwares to evade detection this paper presents an adversary attack pattern that will compromise current machine learning based malware detection methods the malware developers can perform this attack easily by splitting malicious payload into two or more apps the split apps will all be classified as benign by current methods thus we proposed a method to deal with this issue this approach realized in a tool called colludroid can identify the collusion apps by analyzing the communication between apps the evaluation results show that colludroid is effective in finding out the collusion apps also we showed that its easy to split an app to evade detection according to our split simulation the evasion rate is % when split into two apps while the evasion rate comes to % when split into three apps springer nature switzerland ag 
    an urgent lesson learned from fukushima daiichi accident is what can happen by natural disaster can also occur by human design the accident raised a fear that terrorists could cause a similar accident by acts of sabotage against nuclear power plant (npp) and it is noticeable that threats of terrorism for nuclear security are increased after the accident when considering sabotage the prime threat to nuclear power plants due attention should be paid to sabotage by insiders generally insiders are the individuals with authorized access to nuclear facilities in transport who could attempt unauthorized sabotage they could take advantage of their access authority and knowledge to bypass dedicated physical protection elements or other provisions [ ] thus we should value the catastrophic consequences of the attack or act of insider sabotage which may lead to loss of safety functions of npp international atomic energy agency (iaea) indicated that the physical protection system (pps) of a nuclear facility should be integrated and effective against both sabotage and unauthorized removal the primary pps functions are deterrence detection delay and response it is noticeable that if detection failed delay and response would become invalid thus detection of insiders sabotage should be enhanced considering current countermeasures of pps to insiders sabotage the most significant challenge is how to distinguish ordinary maintenance behaviors and malicious behaviors since some malicious behaviors may hidden in ordinary maintenance behaviors it appears that hand behavior has high contribution to human activity and a significant portion of maintenance behaviors and malicious behaviors in this study we proposed a hand behavior detection algorithm for insiders malicious behaviors for nuclear security [ ] we focused on the fact that the hand shape is uniquely determined by the fingertip coordinates first the depth image of the hand was captured with kinect v and after removing the five fingers were remained by removing the palm and wrist parts and the five fingers were identified using the k-means clustering [ ] and the farthest point of each finger from wrist pixel was taken as the fingertip coordinates the fingertip coordinates of the five fingers were combined for frames to be time-series data and this was used as the training data of the neural network time-series data obtained from five kinds of behaviors of five hands was used for training data for the machine learning method the stacked-auto encoder (sae) [ - ] which is one of popular methods was used it extracts the feature of input data at intermediate layer of the first stage in the second layer the extracted feature is input and its feature is extracted to be used as the input of the softmax layer for pattern classification meanwhile a real-time fingertip tracking system was developed and time-series data of each fingertip was successfully obtained with fps using matlab whose cpu was intel xeon processor e-v (m cache ghz) moreover a time-series data analysis based behavior recognition method was developed and all assumed malicious behaviors were detected with high accuracy ( % in overall) and speed ( seconds per frame) in the same computing environment also robustness of the behavior recognition method was verified copyright asme

    computer security threats have always been a major concern and continue to increase in frequency and complexity the nature and techniques of the attacks evolve rapidly over time making their detection more difficult therefore the means and tools used to deal with them need to evolve at the same pace if not faster in this paper the implementation of an intrusion detection system (ids) both at the network (nids) and host (hids) level used at cern is presented the system is currently processing in real time approximately one tb of data per day with the final goal of coping with at least tb day in order to accomplish this goal at first an infrastructure to collect data from sources such as system logs web server logs and the nids logs has been developed making use of technologies such as apache flume [ ] and apache kafka [ ] once the data is collected it needs to be processed in search of malicious activity the data is consumed by apache spark [ ] jobs which compare in real time this data with known signatures of malicious activities these are known as indicators of compromise (ioc) they are published by many security experts and centralized in a local malware information sharing platform (misp) [ ] instance nonetheless detecting an intrusion is not enough there is a need to understand what happened and why in order to gain knowledge on the context of the detected intrusion the data is also enriched in real time when it is passing through the pipeline for example dns resolution and ip geolocation are applied to it a system generic enough to process any kind of data in json format is enriching the data in order to get additional context of what is happening and finally looking for indicators of compromise to detect possible intrusions making use of the latest technologies in the big data ecosystem copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the creative commons

    social media research often exploits metrics based on frequency counts e g to determine corpus sentiment hampton and shalin [ ] introduced an alternative metric examining the style and structure of social media relative to an internet language baseline they demonstrated statistically significant differences in lexical choice from tweets collected in a disaster setting relative to the standard one explanation of this finding is that the twitter platform irrespective of disaster setting and or specifics of the english language is responsible for the observed differences in this paper we apply the same metric to german corpora to compare an event-based (the recent election) with a nothing crawl with respect to the use of german modal particles german modal particles are often used in spoken language and typically regarded as stop words in text mining this word class is likely to reflect public engagement because of its properties such as indicating common ground or reference to previous utterances (i e anaphora) [ ] we demonstrate a positive deviation of most modal particles for all corpora relative to general internet language consistent with the view that twitter constitutes a form of conversation however the use of modal particles also generally increased in the three corpora related to the german election relative to the nothing corpus this indicates topic influence beyond platform affordances and supports an interpretation of the german election data as an engaged collective narrative response to events using commonly eliminated features our finding supports and extends hampton and shalins analysis that relied on pre-selected antonyms and suggests an alternative method to frequency counts to identify corpora that differ in public engagement springer international publishing ag part of springer nature 
    with the proliferation of social media like facebook and twitter more and more people have started depending on it for all sorts of news social media (such as facebook twitter) topical forums wikis etc enable a community of end users to interact or cooperate towards a common goal however the effectiveness of disseminating information through social media lacks in quality as a result of less fact checking low barriers to entry more biases and several rumors thereby making social media not only the source of genuine news but also fake news thus in this paper we are dealing with the problem of classifying information on the basis of its reliability using freely available user generated data like tweets on twitter using machine learning algorithms a variety of machine learning algorithms like linear regression logistic regression nave bayes etc are used to determine the trust carried by the tweets in addition to basic machine learning algorithms we present a learning model that is based on the combination of nave bayes and logistic regression and also nave bayes and linear regression also a technique has been discussed to determine a threshold parameter which is used for the classification of data in case of smo and linear regression algorithm in order to increase their accuracy which is achieved for modified linear regression algorithm in most of the cases the modified linear regression algorithm when used in combination with nave bayes achieves a better accuracy than all the other algorithms used in this paper also hybrid classification works better than the individual algorithms springer nature singapore pte ltd

    nowadays machine learning has been widely used as a core component in botnet detection systems however the assumption of machine learning algorithm is that the underlying botnet data distribution is stable for training and testing which is vulnerable to well-crafted concept drift attacks such as mimicry attacks gradient descent attacks poisoning attacks and so on in this paper we present an active and dynamic learning approach to mitigate botnet hidden concept drift attacks instead of passively waiting for false negative this approach could actively find the trend of hidden concept drift attacks using statistical p-values before performance starts to degenerate and besides periodically retraining this approach could dynamically reweight predictive features to track the trend of underlying concept drift we test this approach on the public ctu botnet captures provided by malware capture facility project the experiment results show that this approach could actively get insights of botnet hidden concept drift and dynamically evolve to avoid model aging springer international publishing ag part of springer nature 
    automatic detection of algorithmically generated domains (agds) is a crucial element for fighting botnets modern agd detection systems have benefited from the combination of powerful advanced machine learning algorithms and linguistic distinctions between legitimate domains and malicious agds however a more evolved class of agds misleads the aforementioned detection systems by generating domains based on wordlists (also called dictionaries) the resulting domains dictionary-agds are seemingly benign to both human analysis and most of agd detection methods that receive as input solely the domain itself in this paper we design and implement method called wordgraph for extracting dictionaries used by the domain generation algorithms (dgas) solely dns traffic our result immediately gives us an efficient mechanism for detecting this elusive new type of dga without any need for reverse engineering to extract dictionaries our experimental results on data from known dictionary-agds show that our method can extract dictionary information that is embedded in the malware code even when the number of dga domains is much smaller than that of legitimate domains or when multiple dictionaries are present in the data this allows our approach to detect dictionary-agds in real traffic more accurately than state-of-the-art methods based on human defined features or featureless deep learning approaches springer nature switzerland ag

    event detection is a very important problem across many domains and is a broadly applicable encompassing many disciplines within engineering systems in this paper we focus on improving the users ability to quickly identify threat events such as malware military policy violations and natural environmental disasters the information to perform these detections is extracted from text data sets in the latter two cases malware threats are important as they compromise computer system integrity and potentially allow the collection of sensitive information military policy violations such as ceasefire policies are important to monitor as they disrupt the daily lives of many people within countries that are torn apart by social violence or civil war the threat of environmental disasters takes many forms and is an ever-present danger worldwide and indiscriminate regarding who is harmed or killed in this paper we address all three of these threat event types using the same underlying technology for mining the information that leads to detecting such events we approach malware event detection as a binary classification problem i e one class for the threat mode and another for non-threat mode we extend our novel classifier utilizing constrained low rank approximation as the core algorithm innovation and apply our nonnegative generalized moody-darken architecture (ngmda) hybrid method using various combinations of input and output layer algorithms the new algorithm uses a nonconvex optimization problem via the nonnegative matrix factorization (nmf) for the hidden layer of a single layer perceptron and a nonnegative constrained adaptive filter for the output layer estimator we first show the utility of the core nmf technology for both ceasefire violation and environmental disaster event detection next ngmda is applied to the problem of malware threat events again based on the nmf as the core computational tool also we demonstrate that an algorithm should be appropriately selected for the data generation process all this has critical implications for design of solutions for important threat event detection scenarios lastly we present experimental results on foreign language text for ceasefire violation and environmental disaster events experimental results on a kdd competition data set for malware classification are presented using our new ngmda classifier springer international publishing ag

    we develop a model of multiwinner elections that combines performance-based measures of the quality of the committee (such as e g borda scores of the committee members) with diversity constraints specifically we assume that the candidates have certain attributes (such as being a male or a female being junior or senior etc ) and the goal is to elect a committee that on the one hand has as high a score regarding a given performance measure but that on the other hand meets certain requirements (e g of the form at least % of the committee members are junior candidates and at least % are females) we analyze the computational complexity of computing winning committees in this model obtaining polynomial-time algorithms (exact and approximate) and np-hardness results we focus on several natural classes of voting rules and diversity constraints copyright association for the advancement of artificial intelligence ( ) all rights reserved 
    every time a major violent act takes place in the united states a public debate erupts as to whether it should be considered terrorism political scientists have offered a variety of conceptual frameworks but have neglected to explore how ordinary citizens understand terrorism despite the central role the public plays in our understanding of the relationship between terrorism and government action in the wake of violence we synthesize components of both scholarly definitions and public debates to formulate predictions for how various attributes of incidents affect the likelihood they are perceived as terrorism combining a conjoint experiment with machine learning techniques and automated content analysis of media coverage we show the importance not only of the type and severity of violence but also the attributed motivation for the incident and social categorization of the actor the findings demonstrate how the language used to describe violent incidents for which the media has considerable latitude affects the likelihood the public classifies incidents as terrorism midwest political science association

    algorithms for the detection and tracking of (moving) objects can be combined into a system that automatically extracts relevant events from a large amount of video data such a system (data pipeline) can be particularly useful in video surveillance applications notably to support analysts in retrieving information from hours of video while working under strict time constraints such data pipelines entail all sort of uncertainties however which can lead to erroneous detections being presented to the analyst in this paper we present a novel method to attribute a confidence of correct detection to the output of a computer vision data pipeline the method relies on a datadriven approach a machine learning-based classifier is built to separate correct from erroneous detections it is trained on features extracted from the pipeline the features relate to both raw data properties such as image quality and to video content properties such as detection characteristics the validation of the results is done using two full motion video datasets from airborne platforms the first being of the same type (same context) as the training set the second being of a different type (new context) we conclude that the result of this classifier could be used to build a confidence of correct detection separating the true positives from the false positives this confidence can furthermore be used to prioritize the detections in order of reliability this study concludes by identifying additional work measures needed to improve the robustness of the method spie

    this paper offers a broad view on foreseeing innovation which is not limited solely to early detection at the micro level the author defines innovations as ongoing processes of changes in the various fields of social and economic life which result from human creative activity noting that innovation is an uncertain relatively chaotic and disordered process characterized by inherent risks the author aims to define the most general and universal barriers impeding one's ability to recognize the signs of future innovation and to anticipate their consequences considering examples of "disruptive innovation" in the technological social political and economic spheres of life the author sees these innovations as arising from certain condition and events not as simple random occurrences most of them are effects of particular causes however these causes are often hidden within events that are difficult to observe and phenomena encapsulated in weak signals the inability to detect and recognize such pre-emerging warnings of upcoming innovations may be attributed to the massive amount of information and noise flooding today's world this problem is exacerbated by the lack of knowledge techniques and experience for dealing with huge amounts of information the lack of the required skills and finally by human cognitive biases faced with this deluge of misinformation any person can eventually be misled and make mistakes this paper posits that in order to mitigate such risks an individual must avoid the three cognitive biases the symmetry of delusions aggressive neglect and the curse of knowledge these cognitive biases are the barriers to foreseeing innovation national research university higher school of econoimics all rights reserved

    we study positional voting rules when candidates and voters are embedded in a common metric space and cardinal preferences are naturally given by distances in the metric space in a positional voting rule each candidate receives a score from each ballot based on the ballot's rank order the candidate with the highest total score wins the election the cost of a candidate is his sum of distances to all voters and the distortion of an election is the ratio between the cost of the elected candidate and the cost of the optimum candidate we consider the case when candidates are representative of the population in the sense that they are drawn i i d from the population of the voters and analyze the expected distortion of positional voting rules our main result is a clean and tight characterization of positional voting rules that have constant expected distortion (independent of the number of candidates and the metric space) our characterization result immediately implies constant expected distortion for borda count and elections in which each voter approves a constant fraction of all candidates on the other hand we obtain super-constant expected distortion for plurality veto and approving a constant number of candidates these results contrast with previous results on voting with metric preferences when the candidates are chosen ad-versarially all of the preceding voting rules have distortion linear in the number of candidates or voters thus the model of representative candidates allows us to distinguish voting rules which seem equally bad in the worst case copyright association for the advancement of artificial intelligence ( ) all rights reserved

    linear transformation is a way to learn a linear relationship between two word embeddings such that words in the two different embedding spaces can be semantically related in this paper we examine the reproducibility and generalisation of the linear transformation of word embeddings linear transformation is particularly useful when translating word embedding models in different languages since it can capture the semantic relationships between two models we first reproduce two linear transformation approaches a recent one using orthogonal transformation and the original one using simple matrix transformation previous findings on a machine translation task are re-examined validating that linear transformation is indeed an effective way to transform word embedding models in different languages in particular we show that the orthogonal transformation can better relate the different embedding models following the verification of previous findings we then study the generalisation of linear transformation in a multi-language twitter election classification task we observe that the orthogonal transformation outperforms the matrix transformation in particular it significantly outperforms the random classifier by at least % under the f metric across english and spanish datasets in addition we also provide best practices when using linear transformation for multi-language twitter election classification springer international publishing ag part of springer nature 
    anomaly detection in a communication network is a powerful tool for predicting faults detecting network sabotage attempts and learning user profiles for marketing purposes and quality of services improvements in this article we convert the unsupervised data mining learning problem into a supervised classification problem we will propose three methods for creating an associative anomaly within a given commercial traffic data database and demonstrate how using the principle component analysis (pca) algorithm we can detect the network anomaly behavior and classify between a regular data stream and a data stream that deviates from a routine at the ip network layer level although the pca method was used in the past for the task of anomaly detection there are very few examples where such tasks were performed on real traffic data that was collected and shared by a commercial company the article presents three interesting innovations the first one is the use of an up-to-date database produced by the users of an international communications company the dataset for the data mining algorithm retrieved from a data center which monitors and collects low-level network transportation log streams from all over the world the second innovation is the ability to enable the labeling of several types of anomalies from untagged datasets by organizing and prearranging the database the third innovation is the abilities not only to detect the anomaly but also to coloring the anomaly type i e identification classification and labeling some forms of the abnormality springer international publishing ag part of springer nature

    design of program secure systems is connected with choice of mathematical models of the systems a widely-used approach to malware detection (or classification as benign-malicious) is based on the system calls traces similarity measurement presently both the set-theoretical metrics (for example jaccard similarity the edit (levenshtein) distance (ed) [ ]) between the traces of system calls and the markov chain based models of attack effect are used jaccard similarity is used when the traces are considered as a non-ordering set the edit distance namely the minimal number of edit operations (delete insert and substitute of a single symbol) required to convert one sequence to the other is used as it reflects the traces ordering and semantics however the time and space complexity of the edit distance between two strings requires quadratic (in symbol numbers) complexity [ ] the traces can also be represented as a system calls graphs [ ] the nodes of which are the system calls (or the items of the q-grams [ ]) that is we can consider the traces description by the ordered string as a partial case of the graph representation for which it is possible to use the same similarity metrics with the same computational complexity this work demonstrates a framework for combining both graph-based and probabilistic models enabling both the analysis of the system robustness to malicious attacks and malicious codes recognition and detection springer international publishing ag part of springer nature

    lu and boutilier ( ) proposed a novel approach based on minimax regret to use classical score based voting rules in the setting where preferences can be any partial (instead of complete) orders over the set of alternatives we show here that such an approach is vulnerable to a new kind of manipulation which was not present in the classical (where preferences are complete orders) world of voting we call this attack manipulative elicitation more specifically it may be possible to (partially) elicit the preferences of the agents in a way that makes some distinguished alternative win the election who may not be a winner if we elicit every preference completely more alarmingly we show that the related computational task is polynomial time solvable for a large class of voting rules which includes all scoring rules maximin copeland for every [ ] simplified bucklin voting rules etc we then show that introducing a parameter per pair of alternatives which specifies the minimum number of partial preferences where this pair of alternatives must be comparable makes the related computational task of manipulative elicitation np-complete for all common voting rules including a class of scoring rules which includes the plurality k-approval k-veto veto and borda voting rules maximin copeland for every [ ] and simplified bucklin voting rules hence in this work we discover a fundamental vulnerability in using minimax regret based approach in partial preferential setting and propose a novel way to tackle it copyright association for the advancement of artificial intelligence ( ) all rights reserved

    the winner determination problems of many attractive multiwinner voting rules are np-complete however they often admit polynomial-time algorithms when restricting inputs to be single-peaked commonly such algorithms employ dynamic programming along the underlying axis we introduce a new technique carefully chosen integer linear programming (ip) formulations for certain voting problems admit an lp relaxation which is totally unimodular if preferences are single-peaked and which thus admits an integral optimal solution this technique gives efficient algorithms for finding optimal committees under proportional approval voting (pav) and the chamberlin-courant rule with single-peaked preferences as well as for certain owa-based rules for pav this is the first technique able to efficiently find an optimal committee when preferences are single-peaked an advantage of our approach is that no special-purpose algorithm needs to be used to exploit structure in the input preferences any standard ip solver will terminate in the first iteration if the input is single-peaked and will continue to work otherwise copyright association for the advancement of artificial intelligence ( ) all rights reserved

    enhancing information retrieval systems with the ability to take the writing style of people into account opens the door for a number of applications for example one can link articles by authorships that can help identifying authors who generate hoaxes and deliberate misinformation in news stories distributed across different platforms authorship verification (av) is a technique that can be used for this purpose av deals with the task to judge whether two or more documents stem from the same author the majority of existing av approaches relies on machine learning concepts based on explicitly defined stylistic features and complex models that involve a fair amount of parameters moreover many existing av methods are based on explicit thresholds (needed to accept or reject a stated authorship) which are determined on training corpora we propose a novel parameter-free av approach which derives its thresholds for each verification case individually and enables av in the absence of explicit features and training corpora in an experimental setup based on eight evaluation corpora (each one from another language) we show that our approach yields competitive results against the current state of the art and other noteworthy av baselines springer international publishing ag part of springer nature 
    the development of social networks has led the public in general to find easy accessibility for communication with respect to rapid communication to each other at any time such services provide the quick transmission of information which is its positive side but its negative side needs to be kept in mind thereby misinformation can spread nowadays in this era of digitalization the validation of such information has become a real challenge due to lack of information authentication method in this paper we design a framework for the rumors detection from the facebook events data which is based on inquiry comments the proposed inquiry comments detection model (icdm) identifies inquiry comments utilizing a rule-based approach which entails regular expressions to categorize the sentences as an inquiry into those starting with an intransitive verb (like is am was will would and so on) and also those sentences ending with a question mark we set the threshold value to compare with the ratio of inquiry to english comments and identify the rumors we verified the proposed icdm on labeled data collected from snopes com our experiments revealed that the proposed method achieved considerably well in comparison to the existing machine learning techniques the proposed icdm approach attained better results of % precision % recall and % f-measure we are of the opinion that our experimental findings of this study will be useful for the worldwide adoption the science and information (sai) organization limited

    because of their automated processing capabilities industrial control systems (icss) currently play a crucial role in plant operations it was not long before ics had been completely insulated from the internet however because of the improved reliability of ics devices and systems we could find only a few plants that did not use ics in conjunction with the internet as a result the extended accessibility of almost every ics component makes such systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks because of this intrusion detection systems which monitor ics network traffic and detect suspicious activities within the components themselves are extremely important previous studies argued that packet intervals could ideally be regarded as indicators of the hazardous status of icss against hacking activities and proposed intrusion detection methodologies relying solely on packet intervals however these methodologies with supervised machine-learning have inevitably been compromised by cyber-attacks whose characteristics are different than those of the training dataset we hypothesize that packet intervals in an ics network used for automated industrial processes which are forced to produce a certain type of periodicity reflect a particular type of packet interval patterns in other words certain anomalous behaviors never fail to interfere with this pattern this paper proposes an intrusion detection method using a singular spectrum analysis to monitor time series packets we evaluated our proposed method on our cybersecurity testbed using penetration tests the results verified the validity of our system realized in the packet interval periodicity furthermore we examined the optimum parameter set for the singular spectrum analysis in the proposed method from this experiment we successfully designated criteria for the parameter-set based on the period of the packet intervals during normal operations the proposed method successfully detected all three types of attacks within sec without producing a false alert during normal operations wit press 
    the paper presents a method for detection of abnormal behaviors related to violent events in urban environments we have further developed a person detection method and introduced a person tracker as an intermediate stage between person detection and anomaly detection the method is presented together with results from evaluations based on real sensor data that have been recorded in a realistic urban environment several scenarios have been recorded such as normal situations a person loitering a person shooting and people escaping from sudden smoke development the method uses sensor data from a static video surveillance system consisting of two visual and two thermal infrared cameras the person detection method combines foreground segmentation with a trained machine learning algorithm which is based on boosting the tracker associates incoming detections to objects (i e people) and generates tracks of world coordinates and velocities of objects the anomaly detection method which is based on the hidden markov model (hmm) fuses information that is derived from the tracker the information contains a number of persons their positions and velocities the results indicate that the person detection method in combination with the tracker can produce robust and accurate observations to the hmm which in turn provide good conditions for accurate anomaly detection spie 
    with the increase of terrorist threats around the world human identification research has become a sought after area of research unlike standard biometric recognition techniques gait recognition is a non-intrusive technique both data collection and classification processes can be done without a subject's cooperation in this paper we propose a new model-based gait recognition technique called postured-based gait recognition it consists of two elements posture-based features and posture-based classification posture-based features are composed of displacements of all joints between current and adjacent frames and center-of-body (cob) relative coordinates of all joints where the coordinates of each joint come from its relative position to four joints hip-center hip-left hip-right and spine joints from the front forward the cob relative coordinate system is a critical part to handle the different observation angle issue in posture-based classification postured-based gait features of all frames are considered the dominant subject becomes a classification result the postured-based gait recognition technique outperforms the existing techniques in both fixed direction and freestyle walk scenarios where turning around and changing directions are involved this suggests that a set of postures and quick movements are sufficient to identify a person the proposed technique also performs well under the gallery-size test and the cumulative match characteristic test which implies that the postured-based gait recognition technique is not gallery-size sensitive and is a good potential tool for forensic and surveillance use ieee 
    fuzzy inference as one of the foundational principal means of approximate reasoning has been widely used to represent and manage imprecision and vagueness in common-sense reasoning with high performance and interpretability fuzzy interpolation a particular type of fuzzy inference strengthens the power of fuzzy inference by enhancing the robustness of fuzzy systems in ensuring that a certain conclusion can always be reached if desired when given antecedent however in real-world applications with interconnected rule bases situations may arise where certain crucial antecedents are absent from given observations if such missing antecedents are involved in the subsequent interpolation process the final conclusion would not be deducible using conventional means this book presents as its main part a novel approach named backward fuzzy rule interpolation and extrapolation this method allows the observations which directly relate to the conclusion to be inferred or interpolated from other antecedents and conclusion based on the scale and move transformation interpolation this approach supports both interpolation and extrapolation which involve multiple hierarchical intertwined fuzzy rules each with multiple antecedents as such it offers a means to broaden the application of fuzzy rule interpolation and fuzzy inference the work presented deals with the general situation where there may be more than one antecedent value missing for a given problem two techniques termed the parametric approach and feedback approach are proposed in an attempt to perform backward interpolation with multiple missing antecedent values in addition to further enhance the versatility and potential of backward fuzzy rule interpolation this method is also extended to support a-cut-based interpolation by employing a fuzzy interpolation mechanism for multidimensional input spaces furthermore a novel approach based on hierarchical bidirectional fuzzy interpolation is proposed in an effort to remove any inconsistencies in a rule base finally from a viewpoint of integrated application analysis experimental studies based on a real-world scenario terrorism risk assessmentare provided in order to demonstrate the potential and efficacy of the hierarchical fuzzy rule interpolation methodology springer nature singapore pte ltd 
    serious concerns have been raised about the role of 'socialbots' in manipulating public opinion and influencing the outcome of elections by retweeting partisan content to increase its reach here we analyze the role and influence of socialbots on twitter by determining how they contribute to retweet diffusions we collect a large dataset of tweets during the st u s presidential debate in and we analyze its million users from three perspectives user influence political behavior (partisanship and engagement) and botness first we define a measure of user influence based on the user's active contributions to information diffusions i e their tweets and retweets given that twitter does not expose the retweet structure - it associates all retweets with the original tweet - we model the latent diffusion structure using only tweet time and user features and we implement a scalable novel approach to estimate influence over all possible unfoldings next we use partisan hashtag analysis to quantify user political polarization and engagement finally we use the botornot api to measure user botness (the likelihood of being a bot) we build a two-dimensional polarization map that allows for a nuanced analysis of the interplay between botness partisanship and influence we find that not only are socialbots more active on twitter - starting more retweet cascades and retweeting more - but they are times more influential than humans and more politically engaged moreover pro-republican bots are both more influential and more politically engaged than their pro-democrat counterparts however we caution against blanket statements that software designed to appear human dominates politics-related activity on twitter firstly it is known that accounts controlled by teams of humans (e g organizational accounts) are often identified as bots secondly we find that many highly influential twitter users are in fact pro-democrat and that most pro-republican users are mid-influential and likely to be human (low botness) copyright association for the advancement of artificial intelligence ( ) all rights reserved

    despite widespread use of commercial anti-virus products the number of malicious files detected on home and corporate computers continues to increase at a significant rate recently anti-virus companies have started investing in machine learning solutions to augment signatures manually designed by analysts a malicious file's determination is often represented as a hierarchical structure consisting of a type (e g worm backdoor) a platform (e g win win) a family (e g rbot rugrat) and a family variant (e g a b) while there has been substantial research in automated malware classification the aforementioned hierarchical structure which can provide additional information to the classification models has been ignored in this paper we propose the novel idea and study the performance of employing hierarchical learning algorithms for automated classification of malicious files to the best of our knowledge this is the first research effort which incorporates the hierarchical structure of the malware label in its automated classification and in the security domain in general it is important to note that our method does not require any additional effort by analysts because they typically assign these hierarchical labels today our empirical results on a real world industrial-scale malware dataset of million files demonstrate that incorporation of the label hierarchy achieves a significant reduction of % in the binary error rate as compared to a non-hierarchical classifier which is traditionally used in such problems ieee

    identifying families of malware is today considered a fundamental problem in the context of computer security the correct mapping of a malicious sample to a known family simplifies its analysis and allows experts to focus their efforts only on those samples presenting unknown characteristics or behaviours thus improving the efficiency of the malware analysis process grouping malware in families is an activity that can be performed using widely different approaches but that currently lacks a globally accepted ground truth to be used for comparison this problem stems from the absence of a formal definition of what a malware family is as a consequence in the last few years researchers proposed different methodologies to group a dataset of malicious samples in families notable examples include solutions combining labels of commercial anti-malware software where possible disagreements are solved by majority voting (e g avclass) and dedicated solutions based on machine learning algorithms (e g malheur) in this paper we first present an evaluation to assess the quality of two distinct malware family ground truth datasets both include the same set of malware but one has labels produced by avclass while the other is based on the clusters identified by malheur then we propose a novel solution for identifying families of similar samples starting from an unlabelled dataset of malware we leverage features extracted through both static and dynamic analysis and cluster samples using the birch clustering algorithm the paper includes an experimental evaluation which shows that birch fits well in the context of malware family identification indeed we prove that birch can be tuned to obtain an accuracy higher than or comparable to standard clustering algorithms using the ground truths based on avclass and malheur furthermore we provide a performance comparison where birch stands out for the low clustering time it provides ieee

    social bots are currently regarded an influential but also somewhat mysterious factor in public discourse and opinion making they are considered to be capable of massively distributing propaganda in social and online media and their application is even suspected to be partly responsible for recent election results astonishingly the term social bot is not well defined and different scientific disciplines use divergent definitions this work starts with a balanced definition attempt before providing an overview of how social bots actually work (taking the example of twitter) and what their current technical limitations are despite recent research progress in deep learning and big data there are many activities bots cannot handle well we then discuss how bot capabilities can be extended and controlled by integrating humans into the process and reason that this is currently the most promising way to realize meaningful interactions with other humans this finally leads to the conclusion that hybridization is a challenge for current detection mechanisms and has to be handled with more sophisticated approaches to identify political propaganda distributed with social bots mary ann liebert inc 
    how should we understand the surveillance state post snowden? this paper is concerned with the relationship between increased surveillance capacity and state power the paper begins by analysing two metaphors used in public post snowden discourse to describe state surveillance practices the haystack and the panopticon it argues that these metaphors share a flawed common entailment regarding surveillance knowledge and power which cannot accurately capture important aspects of state anxiety generated by mass surveillance in an age of big data the paper shows that the nature of big data itself complicates the power attributed to mass surveillance states by these metaphors and those who use them relying heavily on ezrahis distinction between information and knowledge the paper situates this argument concerning the state and anxiety borne of information overload in the context of literature that concerns the state and information management drawing primarily on james scotts work on legibility it argues that the big data born of mass surveillance problematises the concept of information as empowering the state instead understanding mass surveillance in an age of big data requires understanding the relationship between the surveillance state and information in terms of anxiety as well as power the author(s) 
    the increasing number of android devices and users has been attracting the attention of different types of attackers malware authors create new versions of malware from previous ones by implementing code obfuscation techniques obfuscated malware is potentially contributed to the exponential increase in the number of generated malware variants detection of obfuscated malware is a continuous challenge because it can easily evade the signature-based malware detectors and behaviour-based detectors are not able to detect them accurately therefore an efficient technique for obfuscated malware detection in android-based smartphones is needed in the literature on android malware classification few malware detection approaches are designed with the capability of detecting obfuscated malware however these malware detection approaches were not equipped with the capacity to improve their performance by learning and evolving their malware detection rules based on the concept of evolving soft computing systems this paper proposes an evolving hybrid neuro-fuzzy classifier (ehnfc) for android malware classification using permission-based features the proposed ehnfc not only has the capability of detecting obfuscated malware using fuzzy rules but can also evolve its structure by learning new malware detection fuzzy rules to improve its detection accuracy when used in detection of more malware applications to this end an evolving clustering method for adapting and evolving malware detection fuzzy rules was modified to incorporate an adaptive procedure for updating the radii and centres of clustered permission-based features this modification to the evolving clustering method enhances cluster convergence and generates rules that are better tailored to the input data hence improving the classification accuracy of the proposed ehnfc the experimental results for the proposed ehnfc show that the proposal outperforms several state-of-the-art obfuscated malware classification approaches in terms of false negative rate ( ) and false positive rate ( ) the results also demonstrate that the proposal detects the android malware better than other neuro-fuzzy systems (viz the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and the dynamic evolving neuro-fuzzy system) in terms of accuracy ( %) the natural computing applications forum

    twitter is a popular medium for individuals to gather information and express opinions on topics of interest to them by understanding who is interested in what topics we can gauge the public mood especially during periods of polarization such as elections however while the total volume of tweets may be huge many people tweet rarely and tweets are short and often noisy hence directly inferring topics from tweets is both complicated and difficult to scale instead the network structure of twitter (who tweets at whom who follows whom) can telegraph the interests of twitter users we propose the producer-consumer model (pcm) to link latent topical interests of individuals to the directed structure of the network a key component of pcm is the modeling of incentives of twitter users in particular for a user to attract more followers and become popular she must strive to be perceived as an expert on some topic we use this to reduce the parameter space of pcm greatly increasing its scalability we apply pcm to track the evolution of twitter topics during the italian elections of and also to interpret those topics using hashtags a secondary application of pcm to a citation network of machine learning papers is also shown extensive simulations and experiments with large real-world datasets demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of pcm institute of mathematical statistics

    we initiate a line of investigation into biological neural networks from an algorithmic perspective we develop a simplified but biologically plausible model for distributed computation in stochastic spiking neural networks and study tradeoffs between computation time and network complexity in this model our aim is to abstract real neural networks in a way that while not capturing all interesting features preserves high-level behavior and allows us to make biologically relevant conclusions in this paper we focus on the important 'winner-take-all' (wta) problem which is analogous to a neural leader election unit a network consisting of n input neurons and n corresponding output neurons must converge to a state in which a single output corresponding to a firing input (the 'winner') fires while all other outputs remain silent neural circuits for wta rely on inhibitory neurons which suppress the activity of competing outputs and drive the network towards a converged state with a single firing winner we attempt to understand how the number of inhibitors used affects network convergence time we show that it is possible to significantly outperform naive wta constructions through a more refined use of inhibition solving the problem in o() rounds in expectation with just o(log n) inhibitors for any an alternative construction gives convergence in o(log n) rounds with o() inhibitors we complement these upper bounds with our main technical contribution a nearly matching lower bound for networks using log log n inhibitors our lower bound uses familiar indistinguishability and locality arguments from distributed computing theory applied to the neural setting it lets us derive a number of interesting conclusions about the structure of any network solving wta with good probability and the use of randomness and inhibition within such a network

    in spam and malware detection attackers exploit randomization to obfuscate malicious data and increase their chances of evading detection at test time e g malware code is typically obfuscated using random strings or byte sequences to hide known exploits interestingly randomization has also been proposed to improve security of learning algorithms against evasion attacks as it results in hiding information about the classifier to the attacker recent work has proposed game-theoretical formulations to learn secure classifiers by simulating different evasion attacks and modifying the classification function accordingly however both the classification function and the simulated data manipulations have been modeled in a deterministic manner without accounting for any form of randomization in this paper we overcome this limitation by proposing a randomized prediction game namely a noncooperative game-theoretic formulation in which the classifier and the attacker make randomized strategy selections according to some probability distribution defined over the respective strategy set we show that our approach allows one to improve the tradeoff between attack detection and false alarms with respect to the state-of-the-art secure classifiers even against attacks that are different from those hypothesized during design on application examples including handwritten digit recognition spam and malware detection ieee

    recently due to the increase of outsourcing in ic design it has been reported that malicious third-party vendors often insert hardware trojans into their ics how to detect them is a strong concern in ic design process the features of hardware-trojan infected nets (or trojan nets) in ics often differ from those of normal nets to classify all the nets in netlists designed by third-party vendors into trojan ones and normal ones we have to extract effective trojan features from trojan nets in this paper we first propose trojan features which describe trojan nets from netlists based on the importance values obtained from the random forest classifier we extract the best set of trojan features out of the features which can effectively detect trojan nets maximizing the f-measures by using the trojan features extracted the machine-learning based hardware trojan classifier has achieved at most % true positive rate as well as % true negative rate in several trusthub benchmarks and obtained the average f-measure of % which realizes the best values among existing machine-learning-based hardware-trojan detection methods ieee 
    with thousands of malware samples pouring out every day how can we reduce malware analysis time and detect them effectively? malware family classification provides one of good measures to predict characteristics of unknown malware since malware belonging to the same family can have similar features static analysis and dynamic analysis are techniques to obtain features to be used for classifying malware samples to their families static analysis performs analysis based on specific signatures included in the malware static analysis has the advantages that the scope of the analysis covers the entire code and the analysis can be performed without executing the malware however it is very difficult to detect or classify malware variants with only the results of the static analysis because malware developers use polymorphic or encryption techniques to avoid static analysisbased detection of anti-virus software dynamic analysis analyzes malware behaviors so the results of dynamic analysis can be used to detect or classify malware variants one of dynamic features that can be used to detect or classify malware variants is api call sequences in this paper we propose a novel method to extract representative api call patterns of malware families using recurrent neural network (rnn) we conducted experiments with malware samples belonging to families in our experiments we extracted representative api call patterns of malware families on samples as a training set and performed classification on the samples as a test set classification accuracy results using api call patterns extracted from rnn were measured as % on average the results show the feasibility of our approach using rnn to extract representative api call pattern of malware families for malware family classification association for computing machinery

    risk evaluation of the containers remains a difficult task often due to incomplete or ambiguous information on containers in addition the evaluation process needs to be adapted on an ongoing basis to cope with emerging risk factors furthermore high-risk container inspection is commonly hindered by a low inspection capacity which leads to a major issue how can we prioritize the container inspection if the number of suspect containers exceeds the inspection capacity? container inspection prioritizing may be the answer in this paper we propose a novel approach for adaptively prioritizing container inspection (apricoin) first we enhance the container information flow to alleviate the problem of incomplete information by proposing an enhanced container descriptive second we introduce the apricoin algorithm which combines frequent pattern mining and a fuzzy logic system to assess the container's risk score the frequent pattern growth algorithm is proposed to retrieve the key criteria for evaluating container risk this is done through mining frequent criteria sets within the historic data set of container inspections by customs the mined frequent criteria sets are used to assess fuzzy inference rules which are periodically readjusted to integrate new key criteria thereafter the fuzzy logic system uses the obtained fuzzy inference rules to calculate a container's risk score our major contribution consists of providing a new adaptive approach for assessing a container's risk through combining frequent criteria mining and fuzzy logic an illustrative study and a comparison with alternative approaches are performed to validate the proposed algorithm ieee

    in the continual battle between malware attacks and antivirus technologies both sides strive to deploy their techniques at always lower layers in the software system stack the goal is to monitor and control the software executing in the levels above their own deployment to detect attacks or to defeat defenses recent antivirus solutions have gone even below the software by enlisting hardware support however so far they have only mimicked classic software techniques by monitoring software clues of an attack as a result malware can easily defeat them by employing metamorphic manifestation patterns with this work we propose a hardware-monitoring solution sniffer which tracks malware manifestations in system-level behavior rather than code patterns and it thus cannot be circumvented unless malware renounces its very nature that is to attack sniffer leverages in-hardware feature monitoring and uses machine learning to assess whether a system shows signs of an attack experiments with a virtual sniffer implementation which supports features and tests against five common network-based malicious behaviors show that sniffer detects malware nearly % of the time unless the malware aggressively throttle its attack our experiments also highlight the need for machine-learning classifiers employing a range of diverse system features as many of the tested malware require multiple seemingly disconnected features for accurate detection ieee

    detection of drive-by-download attack has gained a focus in security research since the attack has turned into the most popular and serious threat to web infrastructure the attack exploits vulnerabilities in web browsers and their extensions for unnoticeably downloading malicious software often the victim is sent through a long chain of redirection operations in order to take down the offending pages concretely the attack is triggered when a user visits a benign webpage that is compromised by the attacker (called landing page) and is inserted some malicious code inside the user is then automatically redirected to an actual page that installs malware on the user's computer (called distribution page) without his her consent or knowledge while there is a large body of works targeting on detection of drive-by download attack there is little attention on the redirection which is a crucial characteristic of the attack in this paper for the first time we propose an approach to the classification of landing and distribution domains which are important components forming the head and tail of a redirection chain in the attack the methodology in our approach is to use machine learning for text mining on the registered information of the domains called whois we intensively implemented our approach with six popular supervised learning algorithms compared the results and concluded that linear-based support vector machine and cart algorithm-based decision tree are the best models for our dataset which respectively give % and % of accuracy % and % of f score % and % of average precision ieee

    regarding the prominent threat of malware and the predicament faced by current identification technology this paper considers that the primary reason is that the technical features used to identify malware are unstable and user-dependent furthermore an in-depth analysis of those technical features leads us to believe that the root cause lies in the lag of discrimination theory behind practice because every piece of software has a specific task or purpose we propose malware discrimination based on identifying the malicious tasks or purposes we first present a formal definition of a task and then provide further classifications of malicious tasks then based on decidable theory we conclude that tasks are decidable computable and finite which enables us to prove that they are recursive and determinable by establishing a map from software to task we prove that software is many-to-one reducible to corresponding tasks thus we show that software including malware such as computer viruses internet worms and trojan horses is also recursive and can be determined from the corresponding tasks finally a discrimination process and practical examples are presented to verify our theory two key issues are identified for future research on malware discrimination ieee 
    the detection of the malicious application or malware on android platform is a very concerned issue many studies have demonstrated their effect from static property analysis and dynamic analysis however their accuracy and efficacy still cannot satisfy the demand in this paper we propose cscdroid an accurate malware detection approach for android via contribution-level-based system call (sc) categorization different from existing works which use all scs to construct feature vectors so as to determine the security of applications cscdroid first introduces a concept named contribution to quantitatively evaluate scs relevance for malware identification based on the contribution level cscdroid can categorize scs into two types determinate scs and normal scs eventually cscdroid builds a markov chain by replacing all normal scs with one specific sc in the sc sequence then it constructs the target feature vector from the probability matrix and use the support vector machine (svm) to detect android malware such way can effectively reduce the state number of markov chains and cut down the dimension of the feature vectors into the svm classifier our evaluation confirms our approach possesses the malware detection ability with a high accuracy rate ieee

    increasingly sophisticated code obfuscation techniques are quickly adopted by malware developers to escape from malware detection and to thwart the reverse engineering effort of security analysts state-of-the-art de-obfuscation approaches rely on dynamic analysis but face the challenge of low code coverage as not all software execution paths and behavior will be exposed at specific profiling runs as a result these approaches often fail to discover hidden malicious patterns this paper introduces seead a novel and generic semantic-based de-obfuscation system when building seead we try to rely on as few assumptions about the structure of the obfuscation tool as possible so that the system can keep pace with the fast evolving code obfuscation techniques to increase the code coverage seead dynamically directs the target program to execute different paths across different runs this dynamic profiling scheme is rife with taint and control dependence analysis to reduce the search overhead and a carefully designed protection scheme to bring the program to an error free status should any error happens during dynamic profile runs as a result the increased code coverage enables us to uncover hidden malicious behaviors that are not detected by traditional dynamic analysis based de-obfuscation approaches we evaluate seead on a range of benign and malicious obfuscated programs our experimental results show that seead is able to successfully recover the original logic from obfuscated binaries ieee

    the arms race between the distributors of malware and those seeking to provide defenses has so far favored the former signature detection methods have been unable to cope with the onslaught of new binaries aided by rapidly developing obfuscation techniques recent research has focused on the analysis of low-level opcodes both static and dynamic as a way to detect malware although sometimes successful at detecting malware static analysis still fails to unravel obfuscated code whereas dynamic analysis can allow researchers to investigate the revealed code at runtime research in the field has been limited by the underpinning data sets old and inadequately sampled malware can lessen the extrapolation potential of such data sets the main contribution of this paper is the creation of a new parsed runtime trace data set of over labeled samples which will address these shortcomings and we offer the data set itself for use by the wider research community this data set underpins the examination of the run traces using classifiers on count-based and sequence-based data we find that malware detection rates are lessened when samples are labeled with traditional anti-virus (av) labels neither count-based nor sequence-based algorithms can sufficiently distinguish between av label classes detection increases when malware is re-classed with labels yielded from unsupervised learning with sequenced-based learning detection exceeds that of labeling as simply 'malware' alone this approach may yield future work where the triaging of malware can be more effective ieee

    the open nature of android allows application developers to take full advantage of the system while the flexibility is brought to developers and users it may raise significant issues related to malicious applications traditional malware detection approaches based on signatures or abnormal behaviors are invalid when dealing with novel malware to solve the problem machine learning algorithms are used to learn the distinctions between malware and benign apps automatically deep learning as a new area of machine learning is developing rapidly as its better characterization of samples we thus propose deepflow a novel deep learning-based approach for identifying malware directly from the data flows in the android application we test deepflow on thousands of benignware and malware the results show that deepflow can achieve a high detection f score of % outperforming traditional machine learning-based approaches which reveals the advantage of deep learning technique in malware detection ieee 
    the explosive growth of malware variants poses a major threat to information security traditional anti-virus systems based on signatures fail to classify unknown malware into their corresponding families and to detect new kinds of malware programs therefore we propose a machine learning based malware analysis system which is composed of three modules data processing decision making and new malware detection the data processing module deals with gray-scale images opcode n-gram and import functions which are employed to extract the features of the malware the decision-making module uses the features to classify the malware and to identify suspicious malware finally the detection module uses the shared nearest neighbor (snn) clustering algorithm to discover new malware families our approach is evaluated on more than malware instances which were collected by kingsoft eset nod and anubis the results show that our system can effectively classify the unknown malware with a best accuracy of % and successfully detects % of the new malware zhejiang university and springer-verlag gmbh germany 
    the academic security research community has studied the android malware detection problem extensively machine learning methods proposed in previous work typically achieve high reported detection performance on fixed datasets some of them also report reasonably fast prediction times however most of them are not suitable for real-world deployment because requirements for malware detection go beyond these figures of merit in this paper we introduce several important requirements for deploying android malware detection systems in the real world one such requirement is that candidate approaches should be tested against a stream of continuously evolving data such streams of evolving data represent the continuous flow of unknown file objects received for categorization and provide more reliable and realistic estimate of detection performance once deployed in a production environment as a case study we designed and implemented an ensemble approach for automatic android malware detection that meets the real-world requirements we identified atomic naive bayes classifiers used as inputs for the support vector machine ensemble are based on different apk feature categories providing fast speed and additional reliability against the attackers due to diversification our case study with several malware families showed that different families are detected by different atomic classifiers to the best of our knowledge our work contains the first publicly available results generated against evolving data streams of nearly million samples with a model trained over a massive sample set of samples elsevier ltd
    in the social web scenario where large amounts of user generated content diffuse through social media the risk of running into misinformation is not negligible for this reason assessing and mining the credibility of both sources of information and information itself constitute nowadays a fundamental issue credibility also referred as believability is a quality perceived by individuals who are not always able to discern with their cognitive capacities genuine information from the fake one for this reason in the recent years several approaches have been proposed to automatically assess credibility in social media most of them are based on data-driven models i e they employ machine-learning techniques to identify misinformation but recently also model-driven approaches are emerging as well as graph-based approaches focusing on credibility propagation since multiple social applications have been developed for different aims and in different contexts several solutions have been considered to address the issue of credibility assessment in social media three of the main tasks facing this issue and considered in this article concern ( ) the detection of opinion spam in review sites ( ) the detection of fake news and spam in microblogging and ( ) the credibility assessment of online health information despite the high number of interesting solutions proposed in the literature to tackle the above three tasks some issues remain unsolved they mainly concern both the absence of predefined benchmarks and gold standard datasets and the difficulty of collecting and mining large amount of data which has not yet received the attention it deserves wires data mining knowl discov e doi widm for further resources related to this article please visit the wires website john wiley & sons ltd

    android system dominates the mobile operating systems at present compared with ios system android system is more open and has lots of third-party markets with loose audit mechanism therefore there are more malwares in android platform in this paper an android security analysis based on sensitive path identification which includes the static analysis and machine learning methods is presented firstly since malicious behaviors in malwares have their trigger conditions the definition of sensitive path is provided secondly a method is proposed to generate the inter-component call graph based on apk files base in the fact that there are a lot of inter-component call relations in android applications thirdly since the sensitive paths cannot be directly used as features a method is designed to abstract the sensitive paths finally applications apk files are collected from android markets and the existing data sets such as google play wandoujia and drebin to construct a benchmark experiments indicate that the proposed method has higher accuracy ( %) than the method based on api-feature ( %) and its precision recall and f-measure are also better than api-feature method furthermore the scale of the apk file has influence to the experiment results especially in analyzing time (when the apk files are within -mb the average analyzing time is seconds and when the files become larger the time increases significantly) copyright institute of software the chinese academy of sciences all rights reserved 
    since the continuous proliferation of the journalistic content online and the changing political landscape in many arabic countries we started our current research in order to implement a media monitoring system about the opinion mining in political field this system allows political actors despite of the large volume of online data to be constantly informed about opinions expressed on the web in order to properly monitor their actual standing orient their communication strategy and prepare the election campaigns the developed system is based on a linguistic approach using noojs linguistic engine to formalize the automatic recognition rules and apply them to a dynamic corpus composed of journalistic articles the first implemented rules allow identifying and annotating the different political entities (political actors and organizations) then these annotations are used in our system of media monitoring in order to identify the opinions associated with the extracted named entities the system is mainly based on a set of local grammars developed for the identification of different structures of the political opinion phrases these grammars are using the entries of the opinion lexicon that contain the different opinion words (verbs adjectives nouns) where each entry is associated with the corresponding semantic marker (polarity and intensity) our developed system is able to identify and properly annotate the opinion holder the opinion target and the polarity (positive or negative) of the phraseological expression (nominal or verbal) expressing the opinion our experiments showed that the adopted method of extraction is consistent with f-measure springer science business media new york 
    web-borne malware continues to be a major threat on the web at the core of malware infection are for-crime toolkits that exploit vulnerabilities in browsers and their extensions when a victim host gets infected the infection dynamics is often buried in benign traffic which makes the task of inferring malicious behavior a non-trivial exercise in this paper we leverage web conversation graph analytics to tap into the rich dynamics of the interaction between a victim and malicious host(s) without the need for analyzing exploit payload based on insights derived from infection graph analytics we formulate the malware detection challenge as a graph-analytics based learning problem the key insight of our approach is the payload-agnostic abstraction and comprehensive analytics of malware infection dynamics pre- during- and post-infection our technique leverages years of infection intelligence spanning popular exploit kit families our approach is implemented in a tool called dynaminer and evaluated on infection and benign http traffic dynaminer achieves a % true positive rate with false positive rate of % our forensic and live case studies suggest the effectiveness of comprehensive graph abstraction malware infection in some instances dynaminer detected unknown malware days earlier than existing av engines ieee 
    in this paper we present a large-scale study of global trends in software download events with an analysis of both benign and malicious downloads and a categorization of events for which no ground truth is currently available our measurement study is based on a unique real-world dataset collected at trend micro containing more than million in-the-wild web-based software download events involving hundreds of thousands of internet machines collected over a period of seven months somewhat surprisingly we found that despite our best efforts and the use of multiple sources of ground truth more than % of all downloaded software files remain unknown i e cannot be classified as benign or malicious even two years after they were first observed if we consider the number of machines that have downloaded at least one unknown file we find that more than % of the entire machine user population downloaded one or more unknown software file because the accuracy of malware detection systems reported in the academic literature is typically assessed only over software files that can be labeled our findings raise concerns on their actual effectiveness in large-scale real-world deployments and on their ability to defend the majority of internet machines from infection to better understand what these unknown software files may be we perform a detailed analysis of their properties we then explore whether it is possible to extend the labeling of software downloads by building a rule-based system that automatically learns from the available ground truth and can be used to identify many more benign and malicious files with very high confidence this allows us to greatly expand the number of software files that can be labeled with high confidence thus providing results that can benefit the evaluation of future malware detection systems ieee

    sentiment analysis of twitter data became a research trend the last decade thanks to the twitter api massive amounts of tweets relating to a topic of interest can be collected in real time performing sentiment analysis of these tweets can be used to conduct social sensing and opinion mining for instance forecasting elections is a primary area in which sentiment analysis of tweets has been extensively applied the last few years sentiment analysis of twitter data presents important challenges compared to the similar task of text classification tweets are limited to characters thus the conveyed message is compressed and often context-dependent the tweets are informal and unstructured usually lacking grammatical soundness and use of a standard lexicon on the other hand tweets are usually annotated by their authors regarding their topic and sentiment with the aid of hashtags and emoticons identifying appropriate features for sentiment analysis of tweets remains an open research area since text indexing methods face the sparseness problem while pos tagging methods fail due to the lack of grammatical structure of tweets character based features i e n-grams of characters are currently getting popular because they are language independent however their effectiveness remains quite low in this paper we argue that tokens used by humans for sentiment analysis of tweets are probably the best feature set one can use for that purpose we compare several automatically extracted features with the features (tokens) used by humans for tweet classification under a machine learning framework the results show that the manually indicated tokens combined with a decision tree classifier outperform any other feature set-classification algorithm combination the manually annotated dataset that was used in our experiments is publicly available for anyone who wishes to use it ieee

    in many voting advice applications (vaas) a supplementary question concerning the voting intention of a vaa user is included the data that are collected through this question can serve a variety of purposes election forecast being one of them however it appears that the majority of vaa users who answer this question select safe choices such as 'i prefer not to say' and 'i am undecided' in this study we investigate at what degree we can predict with the aid of machine learning techniques the voting intention of the above-mentioned users using as input their choices in the vaa policy statements the results show an accuracy higher than % supposed that sufficient training examples for each party that participates in the elections exist so as to model each party users also it appears that there is significant difference on the distribution per party for the users who select 'i prefer not to say' and those who select 'i am undecided' as a consequence of these findings one would suggest that for effective election forecast it is required to (a) distribute the vaa users who select the previously mentioned choices in the voting intention question in a more sophisticated and intelligent way than that followed in traditional poll methods and (b) the vaa users who select each one of those choices should be handled separately ieee 
    even if information hiding can be used for licit purposes it is increasingly exploited by malware to exfiltrate data or to coordinate attacks in a stealthy manner therefore investigating new methods for creating covert channels is fundamental to completely assess the security of the internet since the popularity of the carrier plays a major role this paper proposes to hide data within voip traffic specifically we exploit voice activity detection (vad) which suspends the transmission during speech pauses to reduce bandwidth requirements to create the covert channel our method transforms a vad-activated voip stream into a non-vad one then hidden information is injected into fake rtp packets generated during silence intervals results indicate that steganographically modified vad-activated voip streams offer a good trade-off between stealthiness and steganographic bandwidth association for computing machinery 
    covert channels exploit communication protocols to clandestinely transfer information they enable criminals to hide malicious activities and can be used for secret data exfiltration malware spreading or for the stealthy establishment of command and control structures in this paper we study covert timing channels from a statistical perspective and investigate whether they can be identified as anomalies with unsupervised learning methods we use a testbed to generate covert timing channels based on seven popular techniques and inject them in real captured traffic final datasets are analyzed with diverse outlier detection and classification algorithms our results show that based on their statistical properties covert channels do not occupy low density regions or take extreme values in the problem space and therefore are not detectable as strong anomalies however they present traceable profiles that can be abstracted by supervised learning models such findings reveal that facing the detection of novel (and classic) covert timing channels from an anomaly-detection perspective will probably fail or not suffice instead they must be identified based on the similarity to known schemes using supervised and semi-supervised approaches association for computing machinery 
    machine learning augments today's intrusion detection system (ids) capability to cope with unknown malware however if an attacker gains partial knowledge about the ids' classifier he can create a modified version of his malware which can evade detection in this article we present an ids on the basis of various classifiers using system calls executed by the inspected code as features we then present a camouflage algorithm that is used to modify malicious code to be classified as benign while preserving the code's functionality for decision tree and random forest classifiers we also present transformations to the classifier's input to prevent this camouflage - and a modified camouflage algorithm that overcomes those transformations our research shows that it is not enough to provide a decision tree based classifier with a large training set to counter malware one must also be aware of the possibility that the classifier would be fooled by a camouflage algorithm and try to counter such an attempt with techniques such as input transformation or training set updates copyright john wiley & sons ltd 
    information hiding techniques can implement covert channels which are increasingly used for developing malware that is able to bypass the security layer of modern mobile devices or to covertly exfiltrate data for this reason understanding and detecting this type of threats is crucial to assess the security of modern devices and data unfortunately the detection of information hiding-capable malware is a complex and poorly generalizable task as it is tightly coupled with the specific implementation therefore this chapter proposes to prevent the exfiltration of mobile data by early detection of malicious software considering the correlation of processes running on a device or anomalies in the consumed energy elsevier inc all rights reserved

    users leverage mobile devices for their daily internet needs by running various mobile applications (apps) such as social networking e-mailing news-reading and video audio streaming mobile device have become major targets for malicious apps due to their heavy network activity and is a research challenge in the current era the majority of the research reported in the literature is focused on host-based systems rather than the network-based unable to detect malicious activities occurring on mobile device through the internet this paper presents a detection app model for classification of apps we investigate the accuracy of various machine learning models in the context of known and unknown apps benign and normal apps with or without encrypted message-based app and operating system version independence of classification the best resulted machine learning(ml)-based model is embedded into the detection app for efficient and effective detection we collect a dataset of network activities of different malware families-based apps and genuine apps and use it to develop ml-based detectors we show that it is possible to detect malicious app using network traces with the traditional ml techniques and results revealed the accuracy ( %) in detection of apps in different scenarios the model proposed is proved efficient and suitable for mobile devices due to the widespread penetration of android os into the market it has become the main target for the attackers hence the proposed system is deployed on android environment springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 
    with the exponential growth of smartphone adoption malware attacks on smartphones have resulted in serious threats to users especially those on popular platforms such as android most android malware is generated by piggybacking malicious payloads into benign applications (apps) which are called piggybacked apps in this paper we propose dapasa an approach to detect android piggybacked apps through sensitive subgraph analysis two assumptions are established to reflect the different invocation patterns of sensitive apis in the injected malicious payloads (rider) of a piggybacked app and in its host app (carrier) with these two assumptions dapasa generates a sensitive subgraph (ssg) to profile the most suspicious behavior of an app five features are constructed from ssg to depict the invocation patterns the five features are fed into the machine learning algorithms to detect whether the app is piggybacked or benign dapasa is evaluated on a large real-world data set consisting of piggybacked apps and popular benign apps extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits an impressive detection performance compared with that of three baseline approaches even with only five numeric features furthermore the proposed approach can complement permission-based approaches and api-based approaches with the combination of our five features from a new perspective of the invocation structure ieee 
    risk research has theorized a number of mechanisms that might trigger prolong or potentially alleviate individuals' distress following terrorist attacks these mechanisms are difficult to examine in a single study however because the social conditions of terrorist attacks are difficult to simulate in laboratory experiments and appropriate preattack baselines are difficult to establish with surveys to address this challenge we propose the use of computational focus groups and a novel analysis framework to analyze a social media stream that archives user history and location the approach uses time-stamped behavior to quantify an individual's preattack behavior after an attack has occurred enabling the assessment of time-specific changes in the intensity and duration of an individual's distress as well as the assessment of individual and social-level covariates to exemplify the methodology we collected over million tweets from users located in paris on november and measured the degree to which they expressed anxiety anger and sadness after the attacks the analysis resulted in findings that would be difficult to observe through other methods such as that news media exposure had competing time-dependent effects on anxiety and that gender dynamics are complicated by baseline behavior opportunities for integrating computational focus group analysis with traditional methods are discussed society for risk analysis

    in the cluster based wireless sensor network architecture an effective way to optimize the energy consumption is to implement an energy efficient scheme amongst the participating nodes for major activities such as construction of the hierarchical structure on the regular interval and the data communication from a node to the base station this paper proposes an energy efficient approach for a cluster based wireless sensor network architecture by employing the game theory and ant colony optimization technique initially the proposed work forms various clusters within the network and thereafter the coalitions are formed using the proposed algorithm based on the game theory the proposed algorithm considers the extent of spatially correlated sensed data that are generated by neighbouring nodes in order to form a coalition within a cluster the proposed coalition scheme reduces the number of transmissions across the network it is compared with the competing clustering protocols the simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves the increased network lifetime under the specified quality of service specification (qss) the results of the proposed work are compared with that obtained through the existing low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (leach) and the deterministic stable election protocols (d-sep) the overall improvement gain achieved by the proposed work is % and % at specified qss when compared with the leach and the d-sep protocols respectively thus the simulation results obtained in the proposed work confirm their superiority over the leach and the d-sep protocols springer science business media new york 
    because of the explosive growth of android malware and due to the severity of its damages the detection of android malware has become an increasing important topic in cybersecurity currently the major defense against android malware is commercial mobile security products which mainly use signature-based method for detection however attackers can easily devise methods such as obfuscation and repackaging to evade the detection which calls for new defensive techniques that are harder to evade in this paper resting on the analysis of application programming interface (api) calls extracted from the smali files we further categorize the api calls which belong to the some method in the smali code into a block based on the generated api call blocks we then explore deep neural networks (i e deep belief network (dbn) and stacked autoencoders (saes)) for newly unknown android malware detection using a real sample collection from comodo cloud security center a comprehensive experimental study is performed to compare various malware detection approaches the experimental results demonstrate that ( ) our proposed feature extraction method (i e using api call blocks) outperforms using api calls directly in android malware detection ( ) dbn works better than saes in this application and ( ) the detection performance of deep neural networks is better than shallow learning architectures association for computing machinery 
    both politicians and citizens are increasingly embracing social media as a means to disseminate information and comment on various topics particularly during significant political events such as elections such commentary during elections is also of interest to social scientists and pollsters to facilitate the study of social media during elections there is a need to automatically identify posts that are topically related to those elections however current studies have focused on elections within english-speaking regions and hence the resultant election content classifiers are only applicable for elections in countries where the predominant language is english on the other hand as social media is becoming more prevalent worldwide there is an increasing need for election classifiers that can be generalised across different languages without building a training dataset for each election in this paper based upon transfer learning we study the development of effective and reusable election classifiers for use on social media across multiple languages we combine transfer learning with different classifiers such as support vector machines (svm) and state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (cnn) which make use of word embedding representations for each social media post we generalise the learned classifier models for cross-language classification by using a linear translation approach to map the word embedding vectors from one language into another experiments conducted over two election datasets in different languages show that without using any training data from the target language linear translations outperform a classical transfer learning approach namely transfer component analysis (tca) by % in recall and % in f measure association for computing machinery

    classification is one of the most studied subjects in machine learning most classification methods that were developed this last decade either account for structure (interactions relationships) or attributes (text numerical etc) this leads to ignoring significant patterns in a dataset that could only be captured by analyzing the features of an item and its interactions collective classification methods use both structure and attributes often by aggregating data from neighbors of a node and learning a model on the aggregated data in social networks the degree distribution of nodes follows a power law where few nodes have many neighbors high degree nodes have incoming links from low degree nodes of di erent classes and many nodes have very few edges hence using only local structure may lead to poor predictions also many social networks allow for di erent types of interactions (retweet reply like etc ) that a ect classification di erently this article proposes a collective classification method that makes use of the structure of a network to determine its neighbors it then presents experiments aimed at detecting jihadi propagandists and malware distributors on social networks association for computing machinery 
    attackers have increased the number of infected hosts by redirecting users of compromised popular websites toward websites that exploit vulnerabilities of a browser and its plugins to prevent damage detecting infected hosts based on proxy logs which are generally recorded on enterprise networks is gaining attention rather than blacklist-based filtering because creating blacklists has become difficult due to the short lifetime of malicious domains and concealment of exploit code since information extracted from one url is limited we focus on a sequence of urls that includes artifacts of malicious redirections we propose a system for detecting malicious url sequences from proxy logs with a low false positive rate to elucidate an effective approach of malicious url sequence detection we compared three approaches individual-based approach convolutional neural network (cnn) and our newly developed event de-noising cnn (edcnn) our edcnn is a new cnn to reduce the negative effect of benign urls redirected from compromised websites included in malicious url sequences our evaluation shows that the edcnn lowers the operation cost of malware infection by reducing % of false alerts compared with a cnn when users access compromised websites but do not obtain exploit code due to browser fingerprinting ieee 
    damage caused by malware is a serious problem that needs to be addressed the recent rise in the spread of evasive malware has made it difficult to detect it at the pre-infection timing malware detection at post-infection timing is a promising approach that fulfills this gap given this background this work aims to identify likely malware-infected devices from the measurement of internet traffic the advantage of the traffic-measurement-based approach is that it enables us to monitor a large number of clients if we find a client as a source of malicious traffic the client is likely a malware-infected device since the majority of malware today makes use of the web as a means to communicate with the c&c servers that reside on the external network we leverage information recorded in the http headers to discriminate between malicious and legitimate traffic to make our approach scalable and robust we develop the automatic template generation scheme that drastically reduces the amount of information to be kept while achieving the high accuracy of classification since it does not make use of any domain knowledge the approach should be robust against changes of malware we apply several classifiers which include machine learning algorithms to the extracted templates and classify traffic into two categories malicious and legitimate our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach discriminates between malicious and legitimate traffic with up to % precision while maintaining the false positive below % ieee

    as a vital component of variety cyber attacks malicious domain detection becomes a hot topic for cyber security several recent techniques are proposed to identify malicious domains through analysis of dns data because much of global information in dns data which cannot be affected by the attackers the attackers always recycle resources so they frequently change the domain - ip resolutions and create new domains to avoid detection therefore multiple malicious domains are hosted by the same ips and multiple ips also host same malicious domains in simultaneously which create intrinsic association among them hence using the labeled domains which can be traced back from queries history of all domains to verify and figure out the association of them all graphs seem the best candidate to represent for this relationship and there are many algorithms developed on graph with high performance a graph-based interface can be developed and transformed to the graph mining task of inferring graph node's reputation scores using improvements of the belief propagation algorithm then higher reputation scores the nodes reveal the more malicious probabilities they infer for demonstration this paper proposes a malicious domain detection technique and evaluates on a real-world dataset the dataset is collected from dns data servers which will be used for building a dns graph the proposed technique achieves high performance in accuracy rates over % precision and recall rates as % % especially with a small set of labeled domains (legitimate and malicious domains) the technique can discover a large set of potential malicious domains the results indicate that the method is strongly effective in detecting malicious domains ieee

    detection of malicious software at the hardware level is emerging as an effective solution to increasing security threats hardware based detectors rely on machine learning(ml) classifiers to detect malware-like execution pattern based on hardware performance counters(hpc) information at runtime the effectiveness of these learning methods mainly relies on the information provided by expensive-to-implement limited number of hpc this paper is the first attempt to thoroughly analyze various robust machine learning methods to classify benign and malware applications given the limited availability of hpc the analysis results help guiding architectural decision on what hardware performance counters are needed most to effectively improve ml classification accuracy for software implementation we fully implemented these classifier at os kernel to understand various software overheads the software implementation of these classifiers are found to be relatively slow with the execution time in the range of milliseconds order of magnitude higher than the latency needed to capture malware at runtime this is calling for hardware accelerated implementation of these algorithms for hardware implementation we have synthesized the studied classifier models on fpga to compare various design parameters including logic area power and latency the results show that while complex ml classifier such as multilayerperceptron and logistics are achieving close to % accuracy after taking into consideration their implementation overheads they perform worst in terms of pdp accuracy area and latency compared to simpler but slightly less accurate rule based and tree based classifiers our results further show oner to be the most cost-effective classifier with more than % accuracy and fast execution time of less than ns achieving highest accuracy per logic area while mainly relying on only a single branch-instruction hpc information acm

    this paper proposes a new technique for detecting mobile malware based on information ow analysis our approach focuses on the structure of information ows we gather in our analysis and the patterns of behavior present in information ows our analysis not only gathers simple ows that have a single source and a single sink but also multi-flows that either start from a single source and ow to multiple sinks or start from multiple sources and ow to a single sink this analysis captures more complex behavior that both recent malware and recent benign applications exhibit we leverage n-gram analysis to understand both unique and common behavioral patterns present in multi-flows our tool leverages n-gram analysis over sequences of api calls that occur along control ow paths in multi-flows to precisely analyze multi-flows with respect to app behavior using our approach we show that there is a need to look beyond simple ows in order to effectively leverage information ow analysis for malware detection by analyzing recently-collected malware we show there has been an evolution in malware beyond simply collecting sensitive information and immediately exposing it many previous systems focus on identifying the existence of simple information ows i e considering an information ow as just a (source sink) pair however modern malware performs complex computations before during and after collecting sensitive information and tends to aggregate data before exposing it a simple (source sink) view of information ow does not adequately capture such behavior the uniqueness of our approach comes from the following two features first our information ow analysis represent an information ow not as a simple (source sink) pair but as a sequence of api calls this gives us the ability to distinguish different ows with same sources and sinks based on the computation performed along the information ow second our information ow analysis detects multi-flows ows that either start with a single source and ow to multiple sinks or start with multiple sources and ow to a single sink we treat such ows as a single ow instead of multiple distinct ows fig shows a comparison of a multi-flow and its corresponding simple ows this allows us to examine the structure of the ows themselves we leverage machine learning techniques to extract features from multi-flows and their api sequences (n-gram analysis) and use these features to perform svm-based classification based on this approach we build an open source implementation of multi-flow analysis and api sequencing in the blueseal framework [ ] [ ] [ ] along with n-gram analysis and a svm-based classifier we also conduct a detailed evaluation study highlighting the differences in old and new apps we leverage the app behavior extracted as features from both multi-flows and their api usage patterns and apply machine learning techniques to automatically identify malware based on the structure of its computation over sensitive data we test our tool on a set of benign apps downloaded from google play and known malicious apps our results show that app behavior difference on sensitive data can be a significant factor in malware detection 
    protecting computer systems is a critical and ongoing problem given that real-time malware detection is hard the state-of-the-art for defense cannot keep pace with the increasing level of sophistication of malware the industry for instance relies heavily on anti-virus technology for threat which is effective for malware with known signatures but not sustainable given the massive amount of malware samples released daily as well as and its inefficacy in dealing with zero-day and polymorphic metamorphic malware (practical detection rates range from % to %) behavior-based approaches attempt to identify malware behaviors using instruction sequences computation trace logic and system (or api) call sequences these solutions have been mostly based on conventional machine learning (ml) models with hand-craft features such as k-nearest neighbor svm and decision tree algorithms however current solutions based on ml suffer from high false-positive rates mainly because of (i) the complexity and diversity of current software and malware which are hard to capture during the learning phase of thealgorithms (ii) sub-optimal feature extraction and (iii) limited outdated dataset since malware has been continuously evolving existing protection mechanisms do not cope well with the increasedsophistication and complexity of these attacks especially those performed by advanced persistent threats (apt) which are multi-module stealthy and target-focused furthermore malware campaigns are not homogeneous-malware sophistication varies depending on the target the type of service exploited as part of the attack (e g internet banking relationship sites) the attack spreading source (e g phishing drive-by downloads) and the location of the target the accuracy of malware classification depends on gaining sufficient context information and extracting meaningful abstraction of behaviors in problems about detecting malicious behavior based on sequence of system calls longer sequences likely contain more information however classical ml-based detectors (i e random forest naive bayes) often use short windows of system calls during the decision process and may not be able to extract enough features for accurate detection in a long term window thus the main drawback of such approaches is to accomplish accurate detection since it is difficult to analyze complex and longer sequences of malicious behaviors with limited window sizes especially when malicious and benign behaviors are interposed in contrast deep learning models are capable of analyzing longer sequences of system calls and making better decisions through higher level information extraction and semantic knowledge learning however deep learning requires more computation time to estimate the probability of detection when the model needs to be retrained incrementally a common requirement for malware detection when new variants and samples are frequently added to the training set the trade-off is challenging fast and not-so-accurate (classical ml methods) versus time-consuming and accurate detection (emerging deep learning methods) our proposal is to leverage the best of the two worlds with spectrum a practical multi-stage malware-detection system operating in collaboration with the operating system (os) ieee

    in order to avoid detection malware can disguise itself as a legitimate program or hijack system processes to reach its goals commonly used signature-based intrusion detection systems (ids) struggle to distinguish between these processes and are thus only of limited use to detect such attacks they also have the shortcoming that they need to be updated frequently to possess the latest malware definitions this makes them inherently prone to missing novel attack techniques misuse detection idss however overcome this problem by maintaining a ground truth of normal application behavior while reporting deviations as anomalies in our approach we try to accomplish this by observing a process' memory consumption this is for two reasons we expect the readings to be less volatile in comparison to for instance network operations second by breaking the problem down we are able to investigate thoroughly while still laying the foundations for future expansion we use the observations from a given host to train a machine learning algorithm after an initial learning phase we evaluate the model with readings from the application it has been trained on and other applications in order to assess its quality our results indicate that the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on parametrizing the machine learning algorithm appropriately a large variance in accuracy with only slightly altered inputs confirms this suggestion we finish with a discussion on deploying such an ids at scale in a realistic scenario ieee

    with the rapid growth of internet applications sequential prediction in collaborative filtering has become an emerging and crucial task given the behavioral history of a specific user predicting his or her next choice plays a key role in improving various online services meanwhile there are more and more scenarios with multiple types of behaviors while existing works mainly study sequences with a single type of behavior as a widely used approach markov chain based models are based on a strong independence assumption as two classical neural network methods for modeling sequences recurrent neural networks cannot well model short-term contexts and the log-bilinear model is not suitable for long-term contexts in this paper we propose a recurrent log-bilinear (rlbl) model it can model multiple types of behaviors in historical sequences with behavior-specific transition matrices rlbl applies a recurrent structure for modeling long-term contexts it models several items in each hidden layer and employs position-specific transition matrices for modeling short-term contexts moreover considering continuous time difference in behavioral history is a key factor for dynamic prediction we further extend rlbl and replace position-specific transition matrices with time-specific transition matrices and accordingly propose a time-aware recurrent log-bilinear (ta-rlbl) model experimental results show that the proposed rlbl model and ta-rlbl model yield significant improvements over the competitive compared methods on three datasets i e movielens-m dataset global terrorism database and tmall dataset with different numbers of behavior types ieee 
    in the digital age the interaction between privacy data protection and advanced technological developments such as big data analytics has become pertinent to europol's effectiveness in providing accurate crime analyses for the purposes of preventing and combating crime falling within the scope of its objectives it is imperative for europol to employ the fullest and most up-to-date information and technical capabilities possible whilst respecting fundamental human rights the present article addresses precisely the paradox of on one side protecting fundamental human rights against external terrorist and or cybercrime intrusions and on the other providing a privacy-conscious approach to data collection and analytics so that europol can even more effectively support and strengthen action in protecting society against internal threats in a proportionate responsible and legitimate manner the advantage proposed in this very context of large quantities of data informing strategic analysis at europol is a purpose-oriented data protection impact assessment namely the evolution from traditional instruments in the fight against organised crime and terrorism to more technologically advanced ones equally requires an alteration of the conventional notions of privacy and investigative and information-sharing methods daniel drewer and vesela miladinova

    android security incidents occurred frequently in recent years this motivates us to study mobile app security especially in android open mobile operating system in this paper we propose a novel hybrid approach for mobile malware detection by adopting both dynamic analysis and static analysis we collect execution data of sample malware and benign apps using a net link technology to generate patterns of system calls related to file and network access furthermore we build up a malicious pattern set and a normal pattern set by comparing the patterns of malware and benign apps with each other for detecting an unknown app we use a dynamic method to collect its system calling data we then compare them with both the malicious and normal pattern sets offline in order to judge the unknown app based on the test on a set of mobile malware and benign apps we found that our approach achieves better detection success rate than some methods using either static analysis or dynamic analysis what is more the proposed approach is generic which can detect different types of malware effectively its detection accuracy can be further improved since the pattern sets can be automatically optimized through self-learning elsevier inc 
    traditional signature-based method fails to identify the obfuscated malicious codes while the dynamic method consumes a large amount of resources currently most machine-learning-based detection methods cannot effectively distinguish trojan horses worms and other malwares hence we propose a new classification method based on malicious behavior features the new method first learns specific malicious behavior sequential pattern of each malware category on the basis of the extraction of malicious-oriented instruction the sample is projected to the new space which is composed of sequential patterns based on the new feature representation a nearest neighbor classifier is constructed to classify the malicious codes experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively capture the malicious behavior and distinguish the differences among the behaviors of different malware categories so as to improve the classification precision sharply editorial department of journal of data acquisition and processing all right reserved

    malicious applications have become increasingly numerous this demands adaptive learning-based techniques for constructing malware detection engines instead of the traditional manual-based strategies prior work in learning-based malware detection engines primarily focuses on dynamic trace analysis and byte-level n-grams our approach in this paper differs in that we use compiler intermediate representations i e the callgraph representation of binaries using graph-based program representations for learning provides structure of the program which can be used to learn more advanced patterns we use the shortest path graph kernel (spgk) to identify similarities between call graphs extracted from binaries the output similarity matrix is fed into a support vector machine (svm) algorithm to construct highly-accurate models to predict whether a binary is malicious or not however spgk is computationally expensive due to the size of the input graphs therefore we evaluate different parallelization methods for cpus and gpus to speed up this kernel allowing us to continuously construct up-to-date models in a timely manner our hybrid implementation which leverages both cpu and gpu yields the best performance achieving up to a x improvement over our already optimized openmp version we compared our generated graph-based models to previously state-of-the-art feature vector -gram and -gram models on a dataset consisting of over binaries we show that our classification accuracy using graphs is over % higher than either n-gram model and gives a false positive rate (fpr) of less than % we are also able to consider large call graphs and dataset sizes because of the reduced execution time of our parallelized spgk implementation ieee

    machine learning (ml) models e g deep neural networks (dnns) are vulnerable to adversarial examples malicious inputs modified to yield erroneous model outputs while appearing unmodified to human observers potential attacks include having malicious content like malware identified as legitimate or controlling vehicle behavior yet all existing adversarial example attacks require knowledge of either the model internals or its training data we introduce the first practical demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted dnn with no such knowledge indeed the only capability of our black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the dnn to chosen inputs our attack strategy consists in training a local model to substitute for the target dnn using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the target dnn we use the local substitute to craft adversarial examples and find that they are misclassi fied by the targeted dnn to perform a real-world and properly-blinded evaluation we attack a dnn hosted by metamind an online deep learning api we find that their dnn misclassifies % of the adversarial examples crafted with our substitute we demonstrate the general applicability of our strategy to many ml techniques by conducting the same attack against models hosted by amazon and google using logistic regression substitutes they yield adversarial examples misclassified by amazon and google at rates of % and % we also find that this black-box attack strategy is capable of evading defense strategies previously found to make adversarial example crafting harder acm 
    domain names play a critical role in cybercrime because they identify hosts that serve malicious content (such as malware trojan binaries or malicious scripts) operate as command-and-control servers or carry out some other role in the malicious network infrastructure to defend against internet attacks and scams operators widely use blacklisting to detect and block malicious domain names and ip addresses existing blacklists are typically generated by crawling suspicious domains manually or automatically analyzing malware and collecting information from honeypots and intrusion detection systems unfortunately such blacklists are diffcult to maintain and are often slow to respond to new attacks security experts set up and join mailing lists to discuss and share intelligence information which provides a better chance to identify emerging malicious activities in this paper we design gossip a novel approach to automatically detect malicious domains based on the analysis of discussions in technical mailing lists (particularly on securityrelated topics) by using natural language processing and machine learning techniques we identify a set of effective features extracted from email threads users participating in the discussions and content keywords to infer malicious domains from mailing lists without the need to actually crawl the suspect websites our result shows that gossip achieves high detection accuracy moreover the detection from our system is often days or weeks earlier than existing public blacklists acm

    as our professional social and financial existences become increasingly digitized and as our government healthcare and military infrastructures rely more on computer technologies they present larger and more lucrative targets for malware stealth malware in particular poses an increased threat because it is specifically designed to evade detection mechanisms spreading dormant in the wild for extended periods of time gathering sensitive information or positioning itself for a high-impact zero-day attack policing the growing attack surface requires the development of efficient anti-malware solutions with improved generalization to detect novel types of malware and resolve these occurrences with as little burden on human experts as possible in this paper we survey malicious stealth technologies as well as existing solutions for detecting and categorizing these countermeasures autonomously while machine learning offers promising potential for increasingly autonomous solutions with improved generalization to new malware types both at the network level and at the host level our findings suggest that several flawed assumptions inherent to most recognition algorithms prevent a direct mapping between the stealth malware recognition problem and a machine learning solution the most notable of these flawed assumptions is the closed world assumption that no sample belonging to a class outside of a static training set will appear at query time we present a formalized adaptive open world framework for stealth malware recognition and relate it mathematically to research from other machine learning domains ieee

    industrial control systems (icss) are widely used in critical infrastructures making them popular targets for attacks to cause catastrophic physical damage as one of the most critical components in icss the programmable logic controller (plc) controls the actuators directly a plc executing a malicious program can cause significant property loss or even casualties the number of attacks targeted at plcs has increased noticeably over the last few years exposing the vulnerability of the plc and the importance of plc protection unfortunately plcs cannot be protected by traditional intrusion detection systems or antivirus software thus an effective method for plc protection is yet to be designed motivated by these concerns we propose a non-invasive powerbased anomaly detection scheme for plcs the basic idea is to detect malicious software execution in a plc through analyzing its power consumption which is measured by inserting a shunt resistor in series with the cpu in a plc while it is executing instructions to analyze the power measurements we extract a discriminative feature set from the power trace and then train a long short-term memory (lstm) neural network with the features of normal samples to predict the next time step of a normal sample finally an abnormal sample is identified through comparing the predicted sample and the actual sample the advantages of our method are that it requires no software modification on the original system and is able to detect unknown attacks effectively the method is evaluated on a lab testbed and for a trojan attack whose difference from the normal program is around % the detection accuracy reaches % journal of zhejiang university science editorial office and springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 
    commercial anti-virus software traditionally memorizes specific byte sequences (known as signatures) in the code of previously encountered malware however malware authors can evade signature-based detection in many ways for instance by using obfuscation techniques such as packing (encryption or compression) to hide snippets of malicious code by writing metamorphic malware or by tampering with existing malware we hypothesize that certain evasion techniques can leave traces in the file's entropy signal revealing either similarities to known malware or the presence of tampering per se to this end we present suspend (suspicious entropy signal detector) an expert system which evaluates the suspiciousness of an executable file's entropy signal in order to subserve malware classification whereas traditionally entropy analysis has been used for the goal of packer detection (and therefore entropy-based features often merely comprise mean entropy or the entropy of a few file subcomponents) suspend applies non-stationary time series modeling to aid in malware detection in particular suspend (a) quantifies the amount of structure in the entropy signal (through detrended fluctuation analysis) (b) finds the location and size of sudden jumps in entropy (through mean change point modeling) and (c) computes the distribution of entropic variation across multiple spatial scales (through wavelet decomposition) in addition suspend (d) summarizes the entropy signal's empirical probability distribution because suspend's run time can be made to scale linearly in file size it is well-suited for large-scale malware analysis we apply suspend to a large-scale malware detection task with heterogeneous real-world samples and over million features we find that suspend boosts the predictive performance of traditional entropy analysis (as found in packer detectors) from % to % moreover suspend's focus on entropy signals make it a natural candidate for combining with other types of features for instance combining suspend with a strings-based feature set boosts predictive accuracy from % to % thus whereas traditionally entropy analysis has focused on detecting that a file is packed suspend's more comprehensive representation of the entropy signal appears to be useful to help determine that a file is malicious we illustrate the application of suspend by studying pieces of virransom a family of viral ransomware which could cost millions to large organizations suspend is able to detect % of the studied files with over % confidence whereas a more traditional strings-based model was very closed to undecided and represents the entire family with a single string

    as social networking sites have risen in popularity cyber-criminals started to exploit these sites to spread malwares and to carry out scams previous works has extensively studied the use of fake accounts that attackers set up to distribute spam messages (mostly messages that contain links to scam pages or drive-by download sites) fake accounts typically exhibit highly anomalous behavior and hence are relatively easy to detect as a response attackers have started to compromise and abuse legitimate accounts in this paper we present a novel approach to detect malicious user's accounts in social networks our approach uses a collaborative filtering algorithm for detecting and identifies accounts that experience a sudden change in behavior since behavior changes can also be due to benign reasons (e g a user could switch her preferred client application or post updates at an unusual time) it is necessary to derive a way to distinguish between malicious and legitimate changes to this end we look for groups of accounts that all experience similar changes within a short period of time assuming that these changes are the result of a malicious campaign that is unfolding we developed a tool called abcf (approach based on collaborative filtering) abcf was able to identify malicious and fake accounts in online social networks association for computing machinery 
    the astonishing spread of android os not only in smart phones and tablets but also in iot devices makes this operating system a very tempting target for malware threats indeed the latter are expanding at a similar rate in this respect malware fingerprints whether based on cryptographic or fuzzyhashing are the first defense line against such attacks fuzzyhashing fingerprints are suitable for capturing malware static features moreover they are more resilient to small changes in the actual static content of malware files on the other hand dynamic analysis is another technique for malware detection that uses emulation environments to extract behavioral features of android malware however to the best of our knowledge there is no such fingerprinting technique that leverages dynamic analysis and would act as the first defense against android malware attacks in this paper we address the following question could we generate effective fingerprints for android malware through dynamic analysis? to this end we propose dysign a novel technique for fingerprinting android malware's dynamic behaviors this is achieved through the generation of a digest from the dynamic analysis of a malware sample with respect to existing known malware it is important to mention that (i) dysign fingerprints are approximates of the observed behaviors during dynamic analysis so as to achieve resiliency to small changes in the behaviors of future malware variants (ii) fingerprint computation is agnostic to the analyzed malware sample or family dysign leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing (nlp) techniques to generate the aforementioned fingerprints which are then leveraged to build an enhanced android malware detection system with family attribution the evaluation of the proposed system on both real-life malware and benign apps demonstrates a good detection performance with high scalability ieee

    while the power of social media on the internet is undeniable it has become a major weapon for launching cyberattacks against an organization and its people today there is a growing number of cyberattacks being launched through social media such as posting of false content from hacked accounts posting malicious urls to spread malware and others in this paper we present a simple and flexible unified framework called socialkb for modeling social media posts and reasoning about them to ascertain their veracity a first step towards discovering emerging cyber threats socialkb is based on markov logic networks (mlns) a popular representation in statistical relational learning it learns a knowledge base (kb) on the social media posts and users' behavior in a unified manner by conducting probabilistic inference on the kb socialkb can identify suspicious users and malicious content in this work we specifically focus on tweets posted by users on twitter finally we report an evaluation of socialkb on tweets and discuss our early inference results ieee 
    as the cyber-attack trends are shifted from the volumetric attacks to the multi-layered attacks it is more difficult for the it administrators to find those attack attempts within their system and networks however vulnerability assessment is not easy due to the complex connections between multi-layered applications servers and networks there are many security functionalities but it is hard to apply strong security functionality to every information asset in many cases especially low computing power devices authentication is the only or the first defense mechanism also it administrators continuously remove security vulnerabilities in applications operating systems and networks but security vulnerabilities are repeatedly found due to the vendor's lack of security development process to establish practical security defense strategy in the multi-layered network environment we propose an advanced attack path enumeration methodology based on it asset's reputations and authentication score a predictive attack path enumeration based on our proposed method can help to find the best defense plan we demonstrate our approach by design and implementation of a hacking response measurement system and case study ieee

    there is an increasing need for norms to be embedded in technology as the widespread deployment of applications such as autonomous driving warfare and big data analysis for crime fighting and counter-terrorism becomes ever closer current approaches to norms in multi-agent systems tend either to simply make prohibited actions unavailable or to provide a set of rules (principles) which the agent is obliged to follow either as part of its design or to avoid sanctions and punishments in this paper we argue for the position that agents should be equipped with the ability to reason about a systems norms by reasoning about the social and moral values that norms are designed to serve that is perform the sort of moral reasoning we expect of humans in particular we highlight the need for such reasoning when circumstances are such that the rules should arguably be broken so that the reasoning can guide agents in deciding whether to comply with the norms and if violation is desirable how best to violate them one approach to enabling this is to make use of an argumentation scheme based on values and designed for practical reasoning arguments for and against actions are generated using this scheme and agents choose between actions based on their preferences over these values moral reasoning then requires that agents have an acceptable set of values and an acceptable ordering on their values we first discuss how this approach can be used to think about and justify norms in general and then discuss how this reasoning can be used to think about when norms should be violated and the form this violation should take we illustrate how value based reasoning can be used to decide when and how to violate a norm using a road traffic example we also briefly consider what makes an ordering on values acceptable and how such an ordering might be determined the author(s)

    android is by far the most widely used mobile phone operating system around however android based applications are highly vulnerable to various types of malware attacks attributed to their open nature and high popularity in the market the fault lies in the underneath permission model of android applications these applications need a number of sensitive permissions during their installation and runtime which enables possible security breaches by malware the contributions of this paper are twofold ) we extract a set of dynamic permissions from android applications in a largest publicly available dataset till date ) we evaluate a number of machine learning classification techniques including naive bayes (nb) decision tree (j) random forest (rf) simple logistic (sl) and k-star on the newly designed dataset for detecting malicious android applications the experimental results indicate that although the malware classification accuracy of rf j and sl are comparable sl performs marginally better than the other techniques acm 
    this study reports the results of a multiyear program to predict direct executive elections in a variety of countries from globally pooled data we developed prediction models by means of an election data set covering countries and more than elections and a separate data set with extensive polling data from election rounds we also participated in two live forecasting experiments our models correctly predicted to % of elections in out-of-sample tests the results suggest that global elections can be successfully modeled and that they are likely to become more predictable as more information becomes available in future elections the results provide strong evidence for the impact of political institutions and incumbent advantage they also provide evidence to support contentions about the importance of international linkage and aid direct evidence for economic indicators as predictors of election outcomes is relatively weak the results suggest that with some adjustments global polling is a robust predictor of election outcomes even in developing states implications of these findings after the latest u s presidential election are discussed copyright by the american association for the advancement of science all rights reserved

    a nontraditional game-theoretic approach has been recently suggested for solving multi-objective games (mogs) this paper aims to highlight the applicability and advantage of this approach to cyber security for this purpose we describe a new attack-defence game-theoretic model it involves a zero-sum mog in which the players are undecided about their objective preferences as demonstrated here solving such a unique type of game results in a set of rationalizable strategies wherein each strategy is associated with a set of performance vectors set-based strategy selection techniques are introduced and demonstrated in addition existing evolutionary algorithms to finding the set of rationalizable strategies are discussed the suggested cyber-game model and the nontraditional solution approach are demonstrated using a simple academic example based on the demonstrated case we conclude that the described approach opens up new possibilities for analyzing cyber defense strategies namely it allows tradeoff considerations by eliminating the need to predefine a utility function for each player moreover based on a time-complexity analysis we also conclude that future algorithms for solving real-life multiobjective cyber games by the proposed method should be adjusted for parallel processing finally in view of practical needs for cyber security this paper takes a broader view and discusses how the development of game-based computational tools for cyber defence such as proposed here may benefit not just from evolutionary computation methods but also from other computational intelligence methods such as fuzzy inference systems and artificial neural networks ieee 
    the results of recent votes particularly the u s presidential election and the united kingdom's referendum on leaving the european union (better known as brexit) left many surprised in both cases the postdecision lament went something like this in this age of big data how could the pollsters and pundits have been so wrong in their predictions? i'm just a language guy so i don't pretend to have an answer although surely it's an open question whether polls with their sample sizes in the few thousands count as big data (polling statistics probably fall more under the rubric of medium data ) perhaps that was the problem if preelection and prereferendum analyses could have accessed data points in the millions then might the results have been less surprising? or perhaps what's needed isn't big data on its own but an approach that takes advantage of the many new types of data that are available ieee

    the problem of hardware trojan is certainly serious complex and tricky therefore hardware trojan (ht) detection is difficult time and effort consuming and challenging due to non-trivial threats that compromise the security of integrated circuits (ic) the problem becomes more serious with the extensive outsourcing of ics design and fabrication by untrusted foundries recently hardware trojan detection has gained insight and interest from different researches and industries in order to detect trojan horses in the fabrication phase of an ic in that phase ht detection requires expensive testing techniques hardware trojans in the fabrication phase show that the detection process may be either side-channel based (non-destructive) or reverse engineering based (destructive) the destructive approach consists mainly of three steps ( ) decapsulation ( ) delayering and ( ) imaging for layout identification this paper presents a new approach for automating the third step namely the layout identification of the underlying circuit the proposed approach automatically extracts and describes the features of circuit layout by making use of histogram of oriented gradient features descriptors obtained from such histogram of oriented gradient are then fed to a machine learning classifier represented by a decision tree that aims at learning the pattern of malicious ics in order to differentiate them from benign ones in addition the classification result is enhanced by utilizing adaboost learning algorithm to produce a strong meta-classifier in a chain of cascaded stages based on that scheme a composite classification model is built up to provide an automatic hardware trojan detection and description tool (ahtdt) the proposed model has been tested (on noisy and clean data) and evaluated using iscas benchmark dataset such benchmark is emphasized deliberately to show different trojan examples namely trojan insertion trojan deletion and trojan parametric- inside hardware circuits model simulation and evaluation results have shown a remarkable enhancement in ht detection compared to other reverse engineering detection techniques moreover the proposed approach has the advantages of being automatic systematic and capable of detecting and diagnosing hardware trojans accurately with high detection rate while keeping low false positive rate springer science business media new york 
    the problem of proactively detecting android malware has proven to be a challenging one the challenges stem from a variety of issues but recent literature has shown that this task is hard to solve with high accuracy when only a restricted set of features like permissions or similar fixed sets of features are used the opposite approach of including all available features is also problematic as it causes the features space to grow beyond reasonable size in this paper we focus on finding an efficient way to select a representative feature space preserving its discriminative power on unseen data we go beyond traditional approaches like principal component analysis which is too heavy for large-scale problems with millions of features in particular we show that many feature groups that can be extracted from android application packages like features extracted from the manifest file or strings extracted from the dalvik executable (dex) should be filtered and used in classification separately our proposed dimensionality reduction scheme is applied to each group separately and consists of raw string preprocessing feature selection via log-odds and finally applying random projections with the size of the feature space growing exponentially as a function of the training set's size our approach drastically decreases the size of the feature space of several orders of magnitude this in turn allows accurate classification to become possible in a real world scenario after reducing the dimensionality we use the feature groups in a light-weight ensemble of logistic classifiers we evaluated the proposed classification scheme on real malware data provided by the antivirus vendor and achieved state-of-the-art % true positive and reasonably low % false positive rates with a significantly compressed feature space on a balanced test set of samples ieee 
    smartphones are becoming increasingly popular in daily routines around the world however malware in smartphones is getting more prevalent and will introduce potential risks to smartphone users in this paper we propose a new system called target for detecting malware in the android operating system featuring both static and dynamic analysis our static analysis is based on user permissions signatures and source code and our dynamic analysis is based on the behavior of running mobile applications a highlight of target is its ability to reduce the probability of false positives based on the category of applications target first generates risk values of the mobile application being analyzed indicating the degree of risks involved it then uses a machine learning algorithm named oknn to determine which class an application belongs to compared to previous work tar- get is able to achieve a significant improvement in terms of malware detection accuracy acm 
    any malware designed to be controlled by a remote sys- tem (as required for a botnet) must establish command and control (c&c) with that system as part of establishing and maintaining c&c botnet malware will often send regular messages to the locations of potential c&c servers a practice known as beaconing to avoid detection of these beacons this traffic will be obfuscated and encrypted security researchers have had success with detecting beaconing by looking for traffic at regular time intervals but malware authors are now introducing variation in these time intervals to foil this our research proposes that the regularity of both communication time intervals and data size are a useful feature set for detecting these c&c channels to quantify the regularity of these streams of data we use a nearest-neighbour estimate of entropy that is simple and quick to calculate we then measure mean standard deviation and entropy for time intervals and data sizes of a series of connections between a source and a destination these features are then used as input to a support vector machine which is trained to detect botnet c&c activity this approach was tested on the isot dataset a dataset containing a mix of both benign and malicious real-world traffic using these features we were able to train this classifier to accurately detect a large proportion of the botnet traffic 
    antivirus is most widely used to detect and stop malware and other unwanted files cloud antivirus is a malware detector architecture where virus definitions and other behaviors of suspicious files is analyzed on cloud and controlled by a light weight agent on client system we suggest using two-way caching scheme where local-cache is stored on client system and cloud-cache is present on network cloud where we store virus definitions and behaviors according to collective intelligence techniques local-cache is used to detect the virus and other malware files while offline and cloud-cache uses the artificial intelligence techniques for whole client base to get the most susceptible and prone virus and malware definitions thus increasing the optimality of virus definition search and hence the speed of the whole process gets increased ieee

    as malware industry grows so does the means of infecting a computer or device evolve one of the most common infection vector is to use the internet as an entry point not only that this method is easy to use but due to the fact that urls come in different forms and shapes it is really difficult to distinguish a malicious url from a benign one furthermore every system that tries to classify or detect urls must work on a real time stream and needs to provide a fast response for every url that is submitted for analysis (in our context a fast response means less than - milliseconds url) from a malware creator point of view it is really easy to change such urls multiple times in one day as a general observation malicious urls tend to have a short life (they appear serve malicious content for several hours and then they are shut down usually by the isp where they reside in) this paper aims to present a system that analyzes urls in network traffic that is also capable of adjusting its detection models to adapt to new malicious content every correctly classified url is reused as part of a new dataset that acts as the backbone for new detection models the system also uses different clustering techniques in order to identify the lack of features on malicious urls thus creating a way to improve detection for this kind of threats ieee 
    in this paper we propose the concept of attack scenarios which can be learned and selected from a set of malicious applications and described by sets of android apis to characterize android malware because of its characteristics that produce almost no false-positive attack scenarios can be used as a pre-filter for machine-learning based detectors to enhance the detection performance at low false-positive rate by combining different machine learning techniques we demonstrate that the proposed approach can increase the detection rates to evaluate our approach we analyze android application containing malicious samples on two different machine learning techniques knn and svm the experiment results show that the proposed approach can raise the detection rate up to % malware at % false positive rate and % malware at % false positive rate respectively ieee

    from a crowded field with candidates hillary clinton and donald trump have emerged as the two presidential nominees in the u s presidential election the two candidates each boast more than million followers on twitter and at the same time both have witnessed hundreds of thousands of people leave their camps in this paper we attempt to characterize individuals who have left hillary clinton and donald trump between september and march our study focuses on four dimensions of social demographics social capital gender age and race within each camp we compare the characteristics of the current followers with former followers i e individuals who have left since september we use the number of followers to measure social capital and use profile images to infer gender age and race for classifying gender and race we train a convolutional neural network (cnn) for age we use the face api our study shows that for both candidates followers with more social capital are more likely to leave (or switch camps) for both candidates females make up a larger presence among unfollowers than among current followers somewhat surprisingly the effect is particularly pronounced for clinton middle-aged individuals are more likely to leave trump and the young are more likely to leave hillary clinton lastly for both candidates african americans make up a smaller presence among unfollowers than among followers and the effect is particularly strong for hillary clinton ieee 
    retrieval of images with object-of-interest from a vast pool of social media images has been a research interest in cybercrime research community for detecting criminal behaviors in social media due to inherent diversity and the low duplicate property of images on social media it brings forth many challenges in image retrieval especially in identifying distinct features for a given object-of-interest previous literature approached this problem with extended general hough transform where hough space is analyzed for each specific object-of-interest different objects-of-interest produce different types of patterns in hough space and no unified framework can be easily established to incorporate all those patterns in this paper we propose a unified framework based on convolutional neural network (cnn) for classifying the social media images and retrieving the images based on the probability score from the softmax classifier in our framework a reduced size cnn model is trained by distilling the knowledge from a pre-trained full size cnn model which is suitable for applications with limited training data such as ours and results in a higher accuracy in image retrieval as well as better performance in execution speed in comparison with the full size cnn model experiments on three image datasets relating to suspicious e-crime and terrorist involvement-guy fawkes masks credit card logos and isis logos show that our framework outperforms extended general hough transform and the full size cnn model ieee 
    this poster deals with botnets the most dangerous kind of mobile malware and their detection using neural networks unlike common mobile malware botnets often have a complicated pattern of behavior because they are not managed by predictable algorithms but they are controlled by humans via command and control servers (c&c servers) or via peer-to-peer networks however they have certain common features which have been revealed by analysis of contemporary mobile botnets these features have been used for creation of a neural network training set finally the design of parallel architecture using neural network for useful detection of mobile botnets has been described ieee

    phishing is a considerable problem differs from the other security threats such as intrusions and malware which are based on the technical security holes of the network systems the weakness point of any network system is its users phishing attacks are targeting these users depending on the trikes of social engineering despite there are several ways to carry out these attacks unfortunately the current phishing detection techniques cover some attack vectors like email and fake websites therefore building a specific limited scope detection system will not provide complete protection from the wide phishing attack vectors this paper develops detection system with a wide protection scope using url features only which is relying on the fact that users directly deal with urls to surf the internet and provides a good approach to detect malicious urls as proved by previous studies additionally anti-phishing solutions can be positioned at different levels of attack flow where most researchers are focusing on client side solutions which turn to add more processing overhead at the client side and lead to losing the trust and satisfaction of the users nowadays many organizations make centralized protection of spam filtering this paper proposes a system which can be integrated into such process in order to increase the detection performance in a real time the simulation results of the proposed system showed a phishing urls detection accuracy with % and provided online process of a single url in average time of second ieee

    the most common methods used in cyber attack detection are signature scan and anomaly detection in the case of applying these approaches a countermeasure against an upcoming cyber attack is made only if a signature of cyber attack or an anomaly is detected that means cyber defense systems encounter cyber attacks with no preparation and our study focuses on this problem this time we attempt to discover the useful social data for the prediction of cyber attack motivation and opportunity for the prediction of cyber attack motivation the news articles were used as the dataset as a result using artificial neural networks and the core keywords extracted from the news articles directly correlated to a cyber attack or the news articles not correlated to cyber attack brought better precision recall for the prediction of cyber attack opportunity the security vulnerability feeds were used as the dataset the precision recall of the prediction result was better when using the core keywords as the feature and artificial neural networks as the prediction algorithm - ios press and the authors 
    traditional signature-based methods have started becoming inadequnate to deal with next generation malware which utilize sophisticated obfuscation (polymorphic and metamorphic) techniques to evade detection recently research efforts have been conducted on malware detection and classification by applying machine learning techniques despite them most methods are build on shallow learning architectures and rely on the extraction of hand-crafted features in this paper based on assembly language code extracted from disassembled binary files and embedded into vectors we present a convolutional neural network architecture to learn a set of discriminative patterns able to cluster malware files amongst families to demonstrate the suitability of our approach we evaluated our model on the data provided by microsoft for the bigdata innovators gathering anti-malware prediction challenge experiments show that the method achieves competitive results without relying on the manual extraction of features and is resilient to the most common obfuscation techniques the authors and ios press all rights reserved 
    malicious software (malware) has been extensively used for illegal activity and new malware variants are discovered at an alarmingly high rate the ability to group malware variants into families with similar characteristics makes possible to create mitigation strategies that work for a whole class of programs in this paper we present a malware family classification approach using a deep neural network based on the resnet- architecture malware samples are represented as byteplot grayscale images and a deep neural network is trained freezing the convolutional layers of resnet- pre-trained on the imagenet dataset and adapting the last layer to malware family classification the experimental results on a dataset comprising samples from different families showed that our approach can effectively be used to classify malware families with an accuracy of % ieee 
    in applying machine learning to malware identification different types of features have proven to be successful these features have also been tested with different kinds of classification methodologies and have had varying degrees of success every time a new machine learning methodology is introduced for classifying malware there is the potential for increasing the overall quality of malware classification in the field even new classifiers with the same accuracy as those used previously can be combined using one of a few different ensemble techniques sharpen the classification and raise the accuracy to new heights for our purposes we have attempted to create a coalition of classifiers which each use different features these classifiers when trained provide multiple angles to the same problem and can be used to test ensemble techniques eventually such an ensemble of individual malware classifiers could create a highly precise means of picking out malware from other software specifically we have created a convolutional neural network which processes byte data as an image and a deep feed forward neural network which utilizes opcode n-gram features both of these classifiers while not perfect provide a significant level of classification they achieve this independently of one another and when combined they each contribute enough to improve the final accuracy the majority of the effort in this research was placed on gathering the n-gram features a time and resource intensive process tinkering with the parameters or structure of classifiers could provide further improvements to the system

    models are used to gain a better understanding of complex systems such as the evolution of a population the transportation demand the brain behaviour elections outcome the propagation of a disease system models should be precise and parsimonious however the total variation of the system cannot be precisely captured by the observed variables as there can be unobserved ones influencing the system output the unexplained variation caused by unobserved variables is therefore considered as a noise in the model different models handle that noise in a different way for instance a linear regression assumes that the noise follows a normal distribution and explicitly incorporates it into the model formulation on the other hand other models such as a deterministic neural network do not explicitly incorporate that noise several models can then be applied and the selection of the best one can be a challenging question this research aims to highlight the importance of the unobserved variables on the results of two types of simple yet widely used models feedforward neural networks (ffnn) and logit discrete choice models (ldcm) the first application consists in modelling the divorces in an agent-based microsimulation the agents being the individuals of a given population for each couple in the model the divorce is predicted based on the characteristics of the couple (ex length of the marriage age of the individuals) in this application it is shown that the ldcm outperforms the neural network due to the presence of - possibly many - unobserved variables the second example is a model defined to predict the level of interaction between groundwater and quarry extensions in this application the value of every relevant variable is assumed to be known i e the noise from unobserved variables is minimum in this case it is shown that both approaches perform well but ffnn perform slightly better than ldcm we then investigate how the model performance evolves when the noise increases by removing variables from the models specification finally those two applications will allow us to conclude on the robustness of the discrete choice models and artificial neural network in presence of unobserved variables proceedings - nd international congress on modelling and simulation modsim all rights reserved

    android is targeted the most by malware coders as the number of android users is increasing although there are many android anti-malware solutions available in the market almost all of them are based on malware signatures and more advanced solutions based on machine learning techniques are not deemed to be practical for the limited computational resources of mobile devices in this paper we aim to show not only that the computational resources of consumer mobile devices allow deploying an efficient anti-malware solution based on machine learning techniques but also that such a tool provides an effective defense against novel malware for which signatures are not yet available to this end we first propose the extraction of a set of lightweight yet effective features from android applications then we embed these features in a vector space and use a pre-trained machine learning model on the device for detecting malicious applications we show that without resorting to any signatures and relying only on a training phase involving a reasonable set of samples the proposed system outperforms many commercial anti-malware products as well as providing slightly better performances than the most effective commercial products ifip international federation for information processing

    networking architectures and modern communication technologies have enabled reliable high speed communication for small network systems hosting tens of thousands of users to enterprise systems connecting hundreds of thousands of users across multiple network architectures however this increased reliance on networked systems for communication control and services results in an ever increasing cyber attack surface not only is the attack surface much larger the complexity of network designs utilizing multiple firewalls network address translators (nat) and virtual local area network (vlan) have added a layer of difficulty when determining cyber attacks and their respective operational impact typical network defense tools include utilizing firewalls whitelisting ips network access controls anti-malware software and more prominently deployed intrusion detection systems (ids) ids logs provide the first line in cyber defense and a major indicator of possible cyber threats however ids logs do not provide the network context and network architecture required to accurately assess the degree and depth of a cyber attack security incident and event management systems (siem) and data aggregators such as graylog provide a way to merge multiple data streams for a holistic view of cyber events though do not provide the network paths and context required to make informed operational decisions in this paper we propose a novel use of graph database technologies in conjunction with a k-means clustering algorithm performing data analysis on ids logs the graph database technology enables quick and complex path traversals which would take long lead times with traditional relational databases the k-means clustering algorithm provides a means to analyze groups of events for a more comprehensive view of possible cyber scenarios integration of the two results in a novel means to determine possible network traversals and other potential victims providing a missing piece in existing ids and siem systems the university of new brunswick information security center of excellence (iscx) intrusion detection evaluation and darpa dataset is used to evaluate this new cyber forensics approach focusing on malicious network activity traversal the open source snort system will be used to generate the logs and the network graph database model discussed 
    building machine learning models of malware behavior is widely accepted as a panacea towards effective malware classification a crucial requirement for building sustainable learning models though is to train on a wide variety of malware samples unfortunately malware evolves rapidly and it thus becomes hardif not impossibleto generalize learning models to reflect future previously-unseen behaviors consequently most malware classifiers become unsustainable in the long run becoming rapidly antiquated as malware continues to evolve in this work we propose transcend a framework to identify aging classification models in vivo during deployment much before the machine learning models performance starts to degrade this is a significant departure from conventional approaches that retrain aging models retrospectively when poor performance is observed our approach uses a statistical comparison of samples seen during deployment with those used to train the model thereby building metrics for prediction quality we show how transcend can be used to identify concept drift based on two separate case studies on android and windows malware raising a red flag before the model starts making consistently poor decisions due to out-of-date training by the usenix association all rights reserved

    a number of machine learning based malware detection systems have been suggested to replace signature based detection methods these systems have shown that they can provide a high detection rate when recognising non-previously seen malware samples however in systems based on behavioural features some new malware can go undetected as a result of changes in behaviour compared to the training data in this paper we analysed misclassified malware instances and investigated whether there were recognisable patterns across these misclassifications several questions needed to be understood can we claim that malware changes over time directly affect the detection rate? do changes that affect classification occur in malware at the level of families where all instances that belong to certain families are hard to detect? alternatively can such changes be traced back to certain malware variants instead of families? our experiments showed that these changes are mostly due to behavioural changes at the level of variants across malware families where variants did not behave as expected this can be due to the adoption of anti-virtualisation techniques the fact that these variants were looking for a specific argument to be activated or it can be due to the fact that these variants were actually corrupted copyright by scitepress science and technology publications lda all rights reserved

    previous work has demonstrated that machine learning-based network intrusion detection systems (ids) can be constructed to provide a significant proportion of the accuracy of a conventional signature-based ids while using a fraction of the resources such systems are ideally suited to mobile tactical networks which typically require much denser sensor coverage to ensure complete network protection and have relatively limited size weight and power budgets within which to both protect and operate the network in this study we extend previous work on the extremely lightweight intrusion detection system (elide) and examine its ability to both store a wide range of signatures and generalize to new data we also demonstrate the following ( ) elide weight vectors are capable of storing multiple signatures while not significantly affecting the false-positive rate ( ) such weight vectors can detect packets that match the signatures on which they were trained with a high degree of accuracy (low false-negative rate) and ( ) in addition to approximating the output of a conventional set of signatures elide weight vectors can also weakly generalize to novel malicious traffic we show that despite the significant challenges mobile tactical networks pose for intrusion detection the use of machine learning allows the deployment of approximate signaturebased intrusion detection in such networks spie 
    polarization in american politics has been extensively documented and analyzed for decades and the phenomenon became all the more apparent during the presidential election where trump and clinton depicted two radically different pictures of america inspired by this gaping polarization and the extensive utilization of twitter during the presidential campaign in this paper we take the first step in measuring polarization in social media and we attempt to predict individuals twitter following behavior through analyzing ones everyday tweets profile images and posted pictures as such we treat polarization as a classification problem and study to what extent trump followers and clinton followers on twitter can be distinguished which in turn serves as a metric of polarization in general we apply lstm to processing tweet features and we extract visual features using the vgg neural network integrating these two sets of features boosts the overall performance we are able to achieve an accuracy of % suggesting that the high degree of polarization recorded in the literature has started to manifest itself in social media as well springer international publishing ag

    security monitoring is an area of considerable interest for sites in the worldwide lhc computing grid (wlcg) particularly as we move as a community towards the use of a growing range of computing models and facilities there is an increasingly large set of tools available for these purposes many of which work in concert and use concepts drawn from the use of analytics for big data the integration of these tools into what is commonly called a security operations centre (soc) however can be a complex task - the open source project apache metron (which at the time of writing is in incubator stage and is an evolution of the earlier opensoc project) is a popular example of one such integration at the same time the necessary scope and rollout of such tools can vary widely for sites of different sizes and topologies nevertheless the use of such platforms could be critical for security in modern grid and cloud sites across all scientific disciplines in parallel the use and need for threat intelligence sharing is at a key stage and is an important component of a soc grid and cloud security is a global endeavour - modern threats can affect the entire community and trust between sites is of utmost importance threat intelligence sharing platforms are a vital component to building this trust as well as propagating useful threat data the misp software (malware information sharing platform) is a very popular and flexible tool for this purpose in use at a wide range of organizations in different domains across the world in this context we present the work of the wlcg security operations centres working group which was created to coordinate activities in these areas across the wlcg the mandate of this group includes the development of a scalable soc reference design applicable for a range of sites by examining current and prospective soc projects & tools in particular we report on the first work on the deployment of misp and the bro intrusion detection system at a number of wlcg sites as soc components including areas of integration between these tools we also report on our future roadmap and framework which includes the apache metron project c copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the creative commons

    the article examines the relevance of the so-called 'digital myths' on the example of donald trump presidential electoral campaign the statement about a change of the very quality of politics and its nature in the course of transition to a digital context is the main among digital myths the article claims that the key condition of trump's victory was not an extensive use of digital tools but a proper political strategy the latter's essence was an evident idea achieving an advantage in the battleground states the big data suggested how to do it and the widest possible use of digital tools has paved the way to a victory electoral mobilization consisted of two elements first trump's campaigners mobilized layers of the population that did not attend elections previously and that was not polled were second a susceptible part of the traditional democratic voters among youth women and hispanic americans voted for trump to accomplish these tasks his campaigners made use of a full range of digital tools primarily the biggest advertising platforms such as google and facebook digital media provided trump with a low-cost better targeted and highly resourceful electoral campaign that was far more proficient than hillary clinton campaign the observers disregarded a covered nature of trump campaign and this important factor made his victory quite unexpected the author concludes that the u s presidential campaign was a battleground of two major types of political communication - traditional and new ones the transition to a new type of communication is inevitable since we are entering a new political and social environment of generations that have grown up in a new technological and sociocultural context however even in the context of a new communication paradigm the nature of politics remains the same at the same time new communications seriously transformed the mechanism of political influence on society

    social media platforms have been ubiquitously used in our daily lives and are steadily transforming the ways people communicate socialize and conduct business however the growing popularity of social media adversely leads to wild spread of unreliable information this in turn inevitably creates serious pollution problem of the global social media environment which is harmful against humanity for example president donald trump used social media strategically to win in the usa presidential election but it was found that many messages he delivered over social media were unproven if not untrue this problem must be prevented at all cost and as soon as possible thus analysis of social media content is a pressing issue it is a timely and important research subject worldwide however the short and informal nature of social media messages renders conventional content analysis which is based on natural language processing (nlp) ineffective this volume consists of a collection of highly relevant scientific articles published by the authors in different international conferences and journals and is divided into three distinct parts (i) search and filtering (ii) opinion and sentiment analysis and (iii) event detection and summarization this book presents the latest advances in nlp technologies for social media content analysis especially content on microblogging platforms such as twitter and weibo by world scientific publishing co pte ltd all rights reserved

    traditional antivirus software relies on signatures to uniquely identify malicious files malware writers on the other hand have responded by developing obfuscation techniques with the goal of evading content-based detection a consequence of this arms race is that numerous new malware instances are generated every day thus limiting the effectiveness of static detection approaches for effective and timely malware detection signature-based mechanisms must be augmented with detection approaches that are harder to evade we introduce a novel detector that uses the information gathered by ibms qradar siem (security information and event management) system and leverages anti-virus reports for automatically generating a labelled training set for identifying malware using this training set our detector is able to automatically detect complex and dynamic patterns of suspicious machine behavior and issue high-quality security alerts we believe that our approach can be used for providing a detection scheme that complements signature-based detection and is harder to circumvent springer international publishing ag

    understanding the behavior of malware requires a semi-automatic approach including complex software tools and human analysts in the loop however the huge number of malicious samples developed daily calls for some prioritization mechanism to carefully select the samples that really deserve to be further examined by analysts this avoids computational resources be overloaded and human analysts saturated in this paper we introduce a malware triage stage where samples are quickly and automatically examined to promptly decide whether they should be immediately dispatched to human analysts or to other specific automatic analysis queues rather than following the common and slow analysis pipeline such triage stage is encapsulated into an architecture for semi-automatic malware analysis presented in a previous work in this paper we propose an approach for sample prioritization and its realization within such architecture our analysis in the paper focuses on malware developed by advanced persistent threats (apts) we build our knowledge base used in the triage on known apts obtained from publicly available reports to make the triage as fast as possible only static malware features are considered which can be extracted with negligible delay without the necessity of executing the malware samples and we use them to train a random forest classifier the classifier has been tuned to maximize its precision so that analysts and other components of the architecture are mostly likely to receive only malware correctly identified as being similar to known apt and do not waste important resources on false positives a preliminary analysis shows high precision and accuracy as desired springer international publishing ag

    we discuss a new type of attack on voting systems that in contrast to attacks described in the literature does not disrupt the expected behavior of the voting system itself instead the attack abuses the normal functionality to link the tallying of the election to disclosing sensitive information assumed to be held by the adversary thus the attack forces election officials to choose between two undesirable options not to publish the election result or to play into the adversarys hand and to publicize sensitive information we stress that the attack is different from extortion and not restricted to electronic voting systems springer international publishing ag

    how can individuals and communities protect their privacy against social network analysis tools? how do criminals or terrorists organizations evade detection by such tools? under which conditions can these tools be made strategy proof? these fundamental questions have attracted little attention in the literature to date as most social network analysis tools are built around the assumption that individuals or groups in a network do not act strategically to evade such tools with this in mind we outline in this paper a new paradigm for social network analysis whereby the strategic behaviour of network actors is explicitly modeled addressing this research challenge has various implications for instance it may allow two individuals to keep their relationship secret or private it may also allow members of an activist group to conceal their membership or even conceal the existence of their group from authoritarian regimes furthermore it may assist security agencies and counter terrorism units in understanding the strategies that covert organizations use to escape detection and give rise to new strategy-proof countermeasures copyright association for the advancement of artificial intelligence ( ) all rights reserved

    http is the main protocol used by attackers to establish a command and control (c&c) channel to infected hosts in a network identifying such c&c channels in network traffic is however a challenge because of the large volume and complex structure of benign http requests emerging from regular user browsing activities a common approach to c&c channel detection has been to use supervised learning techniques which are trained on old malware samples however these techniques require large training datasets which are generally not available in the case of advanced persistent threats (apt) apt malware are often custom-built and used against selected targets only making it difficult to collect malware artifacts for supervised machine learning and thus rendering supervised approaches ineffective at detecting apt traffic in this paper we present a novel and highly effective unsupervised approach to detect c&c channels in web traffic our key observation is that apt malware typically follow a specific communication pattern that is different from regular web browsing therefore by reconstructing the dependencies between web requests that is the web request graphs and filtering away the nodes pertaining to regular web browsing we can identify malware requests without training a malware model we evaluated our approach on real web traces and show that it can detect the c&c requests of nine apts with a true positive rate of % and a true negative rate of % these apts had been used against several hundred organizations for years without being detected springer international publishing ag 
    the man-in-the-middle (mitm) attack is one of the most common attacks employed in the network hacking mitm attackers can successfully invoke attacks such as denial of service (dos) and port stealing and lead to surprisingly harmful consequences for users in terms of both financial loss and security issues the conventional defense approaches mainly consider how to detect and eliminate those attacks or how to prevent those attacks from being launched in the first place this paper proposes a game-theoretic defense strategy from a different perspective which aims at minimizing the loss that the whole system sustains given that the mitm attacks are inevitable we model the interaction between the attacker and the defender as a stackelberg security game and adopt the strong stackelberg equilibrium (sse) as the defender's strategy since the defender's strategy space is infinite in our model we employ a novel method to reduce the searching space of computing the optimal defense strategy finally we empirically evaluate our optimal defense strategy by comparing it with non-strategic defense strategies the results indicate that our game-theoretic defense strategy significantly outperforms other non-strategic defense strategies in terms of decreasing the total losses against mitm attacks copyright association for the advancement of artificial intelligence ( ) all rights reserved

    social networks have an ephemerality to them where accounts and messages are constantly being edited deleted or marked as private this continuous change comes from concerns around privacy a potential desire for to be forgotten and suspicious behavior in this study we present a novel task - predicting suspicious e g to be deleted or suspended accounts in social media we analyze multiple datasets of thousands of active deleted and suspended twitter accounts to produce a series of predictive representations for the removal or shutdown of an account we selected these accounts from speakers of three languages - russian spanish and english to evaluate if speakers of various languages behave differently with regards to deleting accounts we compared the predictive power of the state-of-the-art machine learning models to recurrent neutral networks trained on previously unexplored features furthermore this work is the first to rely on image and affect signals in addition to language and network to predict deleted and suspended accounts in social media we found that unlike widely used profile and network features the discourse of deleted or suspended versus active accounts forms the basis for highly accurate account deletion and suspension prediction more precisely we observed that the presence of certain terms in tweets leads to a higher likelihood for that user's account deletion or suspension moreover despite image and affect signals yield lower predictive performance compared to language they reveal interesting behavioral differences across speakers of different languages our extensive analysis and novel findings on language use and suspicious behavior of speakers of different languages can improve the existing approaches to credibility analysis disinformation and deception detection in social media copyright association for the advancement of artificial intelligence ( ) all rights reserved

    participatory budgeting enables the allocation of public funds by collecting and aggregating individual preferences it has already had a sizable real-world impact but making the most of this new paradigm requires a rethinking of some of the basics of computational social choice including the very way in which individuals express their preferences we analytically compare four preference elicitation methods - knapsack votes rankings by value or value for money and threshold approval votes - through the lens of implicit utilitarian voting and find that threshold approval votes are qualitatively superior this conclusion is supported by experiments using data from real participatory budgeting elections copyright association for the advancement of artificial intelligence ( ) all rights reserved 
    today people are increasingly accessing news through social networks like twitter this is regardless of the fact that whether the news is regarding a parliamentary election or a famous entertainment celebrity moreover these platforms allow people to like retweet and comment on the shared news article this shapes the opinions and beliefs of the people who read it along with the news article itself however a major problem we face today is the misuse of these networks for spreading rumors and misleading news content this is the practice of yellow journalism which aims at disrupting public sentiment to address this problem we present a methodology to find credible and relevant tweets that refer to actual news articles published on news websites our methodology scores each tweet based on the reputation of the users sharing it the news publisher which published the news article and the popularity of the news concepts mentioned in the article we model the interaction between these three entities in the form of a tripartite graph and propose a co-hits algorithm based formulation to score all the entities involved the scores of individual entities is used to assign a score for each tweet that indicates the credibility and relevance of the news mentioned in it we find that the presence of many bots is also a big problem in these networks and can affect the results of such explorations thus we use existing bot detection techniques to identify bots and propose an approach to limit their influence on the system in an efficient manner finally we present a qualitative evaluation of our proposed system on a set of approximately tweets springer international publishing ag 
    voting advice applications are online tools that provide users with a voting advice based on their answers to a set of political attitude questions this study investigated to what extent vaa users understand the questions that lead to the voting advice and what search and response behaviour they expose in case of comprehension difficulties two studies were conducted to investigate these issues a cognitive interviewing study among vaa users during the dutch municipal elections in the city of utrecht and a statistical analysis of all answers provided by users who accessed one of the municipal vaas during these same elections results of the two studies show a coherent picture difficult concepts (e g tax names or municipal jargon) geographical locations (e g reference to a specific street) and vague quantifying terms (e g more) all complicate the question in case of comprehension difficulties study shows that vaa users make little effort to solve their problems for example by looking up difficult terms on the internet instead they draw inferences about what the question might mean and proceed to answer nonetheless these are often neutral or no opinion answers which seems to suggest that the meanings of those options are confounded in study however we found that the choice for either a neutral or no opinion response is not accidental semantic meaning problems often result in no opinion answers whereas pragmatic problems are related to neutral responses we discuss the implications of these findings for survey theory and practice european survey research association 
    a systems security must be understood with respect to the capabilities and behaviors of an adversary eve it is often assumed in security analysis that eve acts as maliciously as possible from an economic perspective eve tries to maximize her utility in a game with other participants the games rules are determined by the system and its security mechanisms but eve can invent new ways of interacting with participants we show that eve can be used as an interface to explore the interplay between security and economics in the domain of elections through examples we illustrate how reasoning from both disciplines may be combined to explicate eves motives and capabilities and how this analysis could be used for reasoning about the security and performance of elections we also point to future research directions at the intersection of these disciplines springer international publishing ag

    nowadays machine-learning algorithms are increasingly being applied in security-related applications like spam and malware detection aiming to detect never-before-seen attacks and novel threats however such techniques may expose specific vulnerabilities that may be exploited by carefully-crafted attacks support vector machines (svms) are a well-known and widely-used learning algorithm they make their decisions based on a subset of the training samples known as support vectors we first show that this behaviour poses risks to system security if the labels of a subset of the training samples can be manipulated by an intelligent and adaptive attacker we then propose a countermeasure that can be applied to mitigate this issue based on infinity-norm regularization the underlying rationale is to increase the number of support vectors and balance more equally their contribution to the decision function to decrease the impact of the contaminating samples during training finally we empirically show that the proposed defence strategy referred to as infinity-norm svm can significantly improve classifier security under malicious label contamination in a real-world classification task involving malware detection copyright for this paper by its authors

    there is an inherent adversarial nature in security applications like malware detection systems that intends to mislead the detection system this adversarial nature makes security applications different from the classical machine-learning problem for instance an adversary (attacker) might violate the data stationary assumption that is a common assumption in machine learning techniques this problem named as the domain shift problem arises when training and test data follow different distributions previous studies proposed an adversary-aware feature selection algorithm to improve robustness of the learning systems however prior studies in domain adaptation techniques which are fundamental in addressing domain shift problem demonstrate that original space may not be directly suitable for refining this distribution mismatch because some features may have been distorted by the domain shift in this paper we propose an adversarial-aware feature extraction (afe) model based on domain adaptation technique in order to address domain shift problem the experimental results acknowledge that our model effectively improves the robustness of the learning system under attack copyright inderscience enterprises ltd

    we argue that electronic vote-counting software can engender broad-based public trust in elections to public office only if they are formally verified against their legal definition and only if they can produce an easily verifiable certificate for the correctness of the count we then show that both are achievable for the schulze method of vote-counting even when the election involves millions of ballots we argue that our methodology is applicable to any vote-counting scheme that is rigorously specified consequently the current practice of using unverified and unverifiable vote counting software for elections to public office is untenable in particular proprietary closed source vote-counting software is simply inexcusable springer international publishing ag

    recent events have demonstrated the vulnerability of it-systems of different companies organisations or even governments to hacker attacks simultaneously information technologies have become increasingly established and important for institutions of various branches with respect to modern terrorism developments cyberattacks may be used to physically harm critical infrastructures this leads to a new dimension of cyber-attacks called "terrorist cyber-attacks" this research-in-progress paper aims to develop a process model for data acquisition and support of decision making that seeks to enhance the security of public transportation in the context of counterterrorism therefore a generic process model for terrorist cyber-attacks-produced in the research project re(h)strain-is introduced as a basis for a decision support system (dss) in the future such models could improve the decision process by comparing the effectiveness of different security measures 
    this paper develops a way for analyzing the structure of campaign communications within twitter the structure of communication affordances creates opportunities for a horizontal organization power within twitter interactions however one cannot infer the structure of interactions as they materialize from the formal properties of the technical environment in which the communications occur consequently the paper identifies three categories of empowering communication operations that can occur on twitter campaigns can respond to others campaigns can retweet others and campaigns can call for others to become involved in the campaign on their own terms the paper operationalizes these categories in the context of the u k general election to determine whether twitter is used to empower laypersons the profiles of each account retweeted and replied to were retrieved and analyzed using natural language processing to identify whether an account is from a political figure member of the media or some other public figure in addition tweets and retweets are compared with respect to the manner key election issues are discussed the findings indicate that empowering uses of twitter are fairly marginal and retweets use almost identical policy language as the original campaign tweets the author(s) 
    shortlisting of candidates-selecting a group of "best" candidates-is a special case of multiwinner elections we provide the first in-depth study of the computational complexity of strategic voting for shortlisting based on the most natural and simple voting rule in this scenario -bloc (every voter approves candidates) in particular we investigate the influence of several tie-breaking mechanisms (e g pessimistic versus optimistic) and group evaluation functions (e g egalitarian versus utilitarian) and conclude that in an egalitarian setting strategic voting may indeed be computationally intractable regardless of the tie-breaking rule we provide a fairly comprehensive picture of the computational complexity landscape of this neglected scenario 
    there is increasing interest in promoting participatory democracy in particular by allowing voting by mail or internet and through random-sample elections a pernicious concern though is that of vote buying which occurs when a bad actor seeks to buy ballots paying someone to vote against their own intent this becomes possible whenever a voter is able to sell evidence of which way she voted we show how to thwart vote buying through decoy ballots which are not counted but are indistinguishable from real ballots to a buyer we show that an election authority can significantly reduce the power of vote buying through a small number of optimally distributed decoys and model societal processes by which decoys could be distributed 
    categorical models are a natural fit for many problems when learning the distribution of categories from samples high-dimensionality may dilute the data minimax optimality is too pessimistic to remedy this issue a serendipitously discovered estimator absolute discounting corrects empirical frequencies by subtracting a constant from observed categories which it then redistributes among the unobserved it outperforms classical estimators empirically and has been used extensively in natural language modeling in this paper we rigorously explain the prowess of this estimator using less pessimistic notions we show that ( ) absolute discounting recovers classical minimax kl-risk rates ( ) it is adaptive to an effective dimension rather than the true dimension ( ) it is strongly related to the good-turing estimator and inherits its competitive properties we use power-law distributions as the cornerstone of these results we validate the theory via synthetic data and an application to the global terrorism database neural information processing systems foundation all rights reserved 
    the theory of risk-limiting audits is well-understood at least mathematically such audits serve to create confidence in the reported election outcome by checking the evidence created during the election when election officials introduce election technologies into the voting process it is best to do this after the appropriate auditing framework has been implemented in this paper we describe our experiences with piloting a risk-limiting audit of a referendum that was held in denmark on december at the time of the publication of this paper denmarks election law did not permit electronic voting technologies to be used during voting allowing us to study auditing in isolation our findings are that ( ) risk-limiting audits also apply to paper and pencil elections ( ) election officials usually support risk-limiting audits even if no voting technologies are used because these audits can improve the efficiency of the manual count ( ) that practical and organizational challenges must be overcome to keep audits repeatable in particular it must be possible to identify individual ballots repeatedly and reliably ( ) it is possible to arrange an audit for the result of an earlier stage in a count during a later stage for example an audit of the rough count results fine count and ( ) that whenever the electronic voting technologies are considered auditing should be considered as part of feasibility study springer international publishing ag

    there are increasing threats to healthcare data protection in the united states most federal data privacy laws apply only to specific sectors such as healthcare education communications or financial services in the absence of comprehensive data protection legislation there are multiple sectoral approaches these privacy laws are noticeably limited in their vertical scope preferring downstream protections such as confidentiality security and breach notification hardly any us laws contain upstream requirements that minimize or otherwise limit data collection the imminent eu general data protection regulation (gdpr) is considerably more comprehensive horizontally it applies to all sectors of the economy all broadly defined personal data and all who control or process data vertically it applies protective standards throughout the lifespan of data in the us the primary federal law applying to healthcare data comprises of regulations known as the hipaa privacy and security rules the hipaa rules provide considerably weaker protection than the gdpr although they are far stronger that the protections applicable to other commercial sectors in the us hipaa has relatively narrow scope essentially only applying to data held by traditional healthcare providers and applying only downstream protections confidentiality security and breach notification notwithstanding its weaknesses the hipaa rules are quite detailed and generally well enforced thus hipaa has created expectations in patients that all their healthcare data are safe this is no longer the case either within the hipaa zone or outside of it first traditional providers have almost completed their transition from paper to electronic health records during which they swap the protections inherent in unconnected file rooms for far riskier computerized longitudinal databases second multiple parties outside of healthcare view healthcare data by as having great value big data brokers collect healthcare data or medically-inflected data for their predictive analytics products while cybercriminals long since have recognized the profit in stealing health records third consumer electronics companies continue to disrupt healthcare data markets (and data protection) by encouraging consumers to themselves collect and curate data from mobile health apps wearable devices and the internet of things these challenges to healthcare data protection highlight the fundamental flaws of domain-limited protections and over-reliance on a limited set of protective models the former because disruptive businesses and technological innovations can make a nonsense of narrowly-defined sectoral protections the latter because policymakers need a broader array of tools to combat modern challenges while reliance on downstream models intrinsically concedes the correctness of unregulated data collection the outlook for us healthcare data protection is increasingly bleak in the aftermath of the us election it is quite likely that hipaa rules will be enforced with less enthusiasm encouraging an increase in data leaks from the health care system further those victorious in the election are no friends of pro-privacy regulatory agencies and some of their data protection activities may be reined in it is also extremely unlikely that comprehensive privacy legislation will be passed by the incoming administration yet technological progress and consumer choice almost inevitably will result in increasing amounts of healthcare data being created and processed outside the hipaa-protected zone not surprisingly therefore healthcare data protection in the us faces a perilous future and one that increasingly will be at odds with the protections offered by its trading partners elsevier masson sas
    security analysts spend days or even weeks in trying to understand the inner workings of malicious software using a plethora of manually orchestrated tools devising automated tools and techniques to assist and speed up the analysis process remains a major endeavor in computer security while manual intervention will likely remain a key ingredient in the short and mid term the recent advances in static and dynamic analysis techniques have the potential to significantly impact the malware analysis practice in this paper we show how an analyst can use symbolic execution techniques to unveil critical behavior of a remote access trojan (rat) using a tool we implemented in the angr framework we analyze a sample drawn from a well-known rat family that leverages thread injection vulnerabilities in the microsoft win api our case study shows how to automatically derive the list of commands supported by the rat and the sequence of system calls that are activated for each of them systematically exploring the stealthy communication protocol with the server and yielding clues to potential threats that may pass unnoticed by a manual inspection springer international publishing ag

    what does this or that population think about a given issue? which topics go viral and why? how does disinformation spread? how do populations view issues in light of national master narratives? these are all questions which automated approaches to analyzing social media promise to help answer we have adapted a technique for multilingual topic modeling to look at differences between what is discussed in russian versus english this kills several birds with one stone we turn the datas multilinguality from an impediment into a leverageable advantage but most importantly we play to unsupervised machine learnings strengths its ability to detect large-scale trends anomalies similarities and differences in a highly general way applying this approach to different twitter datasets we were able to draw out several interesting and non-obvious insights about russian cyberspace and how it differs from its english counterpart we show how these insights reveal aspects of how master narratives are instantiated and how sentiment plays out on a large scale in russian discourse relating to nato springer international publishing ag 
    due to the significant development of online advertising malicious advertisements have become one of the major issues to distribute scamming information click fraud and malware most of the current approaches are involved with using filtering lists for online advertisements blocking which are not scalable and need manual maintenance this paper presents a lightweight online advertising classification system using lexical-based features as an alternative solution in order to imitate real-world cases three different scenarios are generated depending on three different url sources then a set of url lexical-based features are selected from previous researches in the purpose of training and testing the proposed model results show that by using lexical-based features advertising detection accuracy is about % in certain scenarios copyright by scitepress - science and technology publications lda all rights reserved 
    social media has played an important role in shaping political discourse over the last decade it is often perceived to have increased political polarization thanks to the scale of discussions and their public nature here we try to answer whether political polarization in the us on twitter has increased over the last eight years we analyze a large longitudinal twitter dataset of users and look at signs of polarization in their (i) network - how people follow political and media accounts (ii) tweeting behavior - whether they retweet content from both sides and (iii) content - how partisan the hashtags they use are our analysis shows that online polarization has indeed increased over the past eight years and that depending on the measure the relative change is % % our study is one of very few with such a long-term perspective encompassing two us presidential elections and two mid-term elections providing a rare longitudinal analysis copyright association for the advancement of artificial intelligence ( ) all rights reserved 
    understanding how terrorist networks are created and how individuals turn into extremism and then into terrorism is a current subject of interest and a cross-domain research problem since it involves scholars from political sciences sociology physics and computer scientists among others in this paper an agent-based approach is used to simulate the process of radicalization and creation of a terrorist network and the link between both processes each citizen has several attributes allowing the model to take into account heterogeneous profiles of individual furthermore we model the social transfer that takes place during the interaction of individuals in order to understand how cultural ideas are transmitted this paper also provides a non-exhaustive but detailed survey of the state of the art on the agent-based terrorist networks modelling by scitepress - science and technology publications lda all rights reserved 
    the goal of multi-winner elections is to choose a fixed-size committee based on voters' preferences an important concern in this setting is representation large groups of voters with cohesive preferences should be adequately represented by the election winners recently aziz et al (a ) proposed two axioms that aim to capture this idea justified representation (jr) and its strengthening extended justified representation (ejr) in this paper we extend the work of aziz et al in several directions first we answer an open question of aziz et al by showing that reweighted approval voting satisfies jr for k = but fails it for k second we observe that ejr is incompatible with the perfect representation criterion which is important for many applications of multi-winner voting and propose a relaxation of ejr which we call proportional justified representation (pjr) pjr is more demanding than jr but unlike ejr it is compatible with perfect representation and a committee that provides pjr can be computed in polynomial time if the committee size divides the number of voters moreover just like ejr pjr can be used to characterize the classic pav rule in the class of weighted pav rules on the other hand we show that ejr provides stronger guarantees with respect to average voter satisfaction than pjr does copyright association for the advancement of artificial intelligence ( ) all rights reserved 
    javascript and actionscript are powerful scripting languages that do not only allow the delivery of advanced multimedia contents but that can be also used to exploit critical vulnerabilities of third-party applications to detect both actionscript- and javascript-based malware we propose in this paper a machine-learning methodology that is based on extracting discriminant information from system api methods attributes and classes our strategy exploits the similarities between the two scripting languages and has been devised by also considering the possibility of targeted attacks that aim to deceive the employed classification algorithms we tested our method on pdf and swf data respectively embedding javascript and actionscript codes results show that the proposed strategy allows us to detect most of the tested malicious files with low false positive rates finally we show that the proposed methodology is also reasonably robust against evasive and targeted attacks copyright for this paper by its authors 
    predicting popularity from social media has been explored about a decade as far as the number of social media users is soaring understanding the relationship between popularity and social media is really beneficial because it can be mapped to the real popularity of an entity the popularity in social media for instance in twitter is interpreted by drawing a relationship between a social media account and its followers therefore in this paper to understand the popularity of candidates of the us election in social media we verify this association in twitter by analyzing the candidates tweets more specifically our aim is to assess if candidates put efforts to improve their style of tweeting over time to be more favorable to their followers we show that mr trump could wisely exploit twitter to attract more people by tweeting in a well-organized and desirable manner and that tweeting style has increased his popularity in social media springer international publishing ag 
    public opinion and election prediction models based on social media typically aggregate weight and average signals from a massive number of users here we analyze political attention and poll movements to identify a small number of social "sensors" - individuals whose levels of social media discussion of the major parties' candidates characterized the candidates' ups and downs over the u s presidential election campaign starting with a sample of approximately accounts on twitter that we linked to voter registration records we used penalized regressions to identify a set of accounts (sensors) that were predictive for the candidates poll numbers ( for hillary clinton for donald trump and for both) the predictions based on the activity of these handfuls of sensors accurately tracked later movements in poll margins despite the regressions allowing both supportive and opposition sensors our separate models for trump and clinton poll support identified sensors for hillary clinton who were disproportionately women and for donald trump who were disproportionately white the method did not predict changes in levels of undecideds and underestimated support for donald trump in september where the errors were correlated with discussions of protests of police shootings copyright association for the advancement of artificial intelligence ( ) all rights reserved

    the federal trade commission (ftc) is the united states chief consumer protection agency through its mandate to prevent unfair and deceptive trade practices it both regulates surveillance and creates cybersecurity law this chapter details how the ftc regulates private-sector surveillance and elucidates several emergent properties of the agencys activities first private-sector surveillance shapes individuals reasonable expectations of privacy and thus regulation of the private-sector has effects on the government as surveillant the ftcs activities not only serve dignity interests in preventing commercial inference in ones life they also affect citizens civil liberties posture with the state second surveillance can make companies directly liable (for intrusive web monitoring for tracking people off-line and for installing malware) or indirectly liable (for creating insecure systems for using deception to investigate and for mediating the surveillance of others) under the ftc act third the ftcs actions substitute for private actions because the class action is burdened in novel ways fourth the ftcs actions increase the quality of consent necessary to engage in surveillance and in so doing the ftc has made some kinds of surveillance practically impossible to implement legally finally the ftcs actions make companies more responsible for their surveillance technologies in several ways - by making software vendors liable for users activities by imposing substantive security duties and by narrowing internet intermediary immunity introduction surveillance evokes notions of big brother - of law enforcement and national security agencies using tools to rein in the bad guys so why should the federal trade commission (ftc) our nations main consumer protection agency occupy a chapter in this volume? the answer is that if the national security agency is the ultimate surveillant on earth the penultimate one may be american businesses this chapter builds on other works in this volume particularly those focusing on the internet of things big data computer networks communications and privacy this chapter details commercial surveillance techniques discusses the incentives for these monitoring programs and explains how commercial surveillance technology may make consumers vulnerable the analysis section also situates the ftcs actions among different approaches to surveillance regulation such as class action litigation and statutory prohibitions cambridge university press

    in the colonel blotto game which was initially introduced by borel in two colonels simultaneously distribute their troops across different battlefields the winner of each battlefield is determined independently by a winner-take-all rule the ultimate payoff of each colonel is the number of battlefields he wins this game is commonly used for analyzing a wide range of applications such as the u s presidential election innovative technology competitions advertisements etc there have been persistent efforts for finding the optimal strategies for the colonel blotto game after almost a century ahmadinejad dehghani hajiaghayi lucier mahini and seddighin provided a poly-time algorithm for finding the optimal strategies they first model the problem by a linear program (lp) with exponential number of constraints and use ellipsoid method to solve it however despite the theoretical importance of their algorithm it is highly impractical in general even simplex method (despite its exponential running-time) performs better than ellipsoid method in practice in this paper we provide the first polynomial-size lp formulation of the optimal strategies for the colonel blotto game we use linear extension techniques roughly speaking we project the strategy space polytope to a higher dimensional space which results in a lower number of facets for the polytope we use this polynomial-size lp to provide a novel simpler and significantly faster algorithm for finding the optimal strategies for the colonel blotto game we further show this representation is asymptotically tight in terms of the number of constraints we also extend our approach to multi-dimensional colonel blotto games and implement our algorithm to observe interesting properties of colonel blotto for example we observe the behavior of players in the discrete model is very similar to the previously studied continuous model copyright association for the advancement of artificial intelligence ( ) all rights reserved 
    cumulative voting is an electoral system in which each voter is allowed to cast multiple votes some or all of which may be duplicate votes for a single candidate it is sometimes used to elect members to a legislative body such as a parliament or city council and its purpose is to achieve a more proportional representation than that which results from many other voting systems cumulative voting is most commonly used in municipal elections in the united states and europe but it has also been used for larger elections and is often used by corporations to elect their directors in this work it will be argued that in all practical scenarios voters who are given the option to split their votes between multiple candidates should refuse to do so and should concentrate all of their votes on a single candidate thus by giving voters multiple votes which the voter may optionally split many jurisdictions are adding unnecessary complication confusing voters and increasing the rate of voter errors and encouraging voters to act against their own interests springer international publishing ag

    preferences are statements about the relative quality or desirability of items ever larger amounts of preference information are being collected and analyzed in a variety of domains including recommendation systems [ ] polling and election analysis [ ] and bioinformatics [ ] preferences are often inferred from indirect input (e g a ranked list may be inferred from individual choices) and are therefore uncertain in nature this motivates a rich body of work on uncertain preference models in the statistics literature [ ] more recently the machine learning community has been developing methods for effective modeling and efficient inference over preferences with the mallows model [ ] receiving particular attention [ ] in this paper we take the position that preference modeling and analysis should be accommodated within a general-purpose probabilistic database frame- work our framework is based on a deterministic concept that we proposed in a past vision paper [ ] in the present work we focus on handing uncertain preferences and develop a representation of preferences within a probabilistic preference database or ppd for short this paper is an abbreviated version of our pods paper where an interested reader can find additional details about the formalism and proposed algorithmic solutions 
    sensors (e g light gyroscope accelerometer) and sensing enabled applications on a smart device make the applications more user-friendly and efficient however the current permission-based sensor management systems of smart devices only focus on certain sensors and any app can get access to other sensors by just accessing the generic sensor api in this way attackers can exploit these sensors in numerous ways they can extract or leak users sensitive information transfer malware or record or steal sensitive information from other nearby devices in this paper we propose thsense a context-aware intrusion detection system which enhances the security of smart devices by observing changes in sensor data for different tasks of users and creating a contextual model to distinguish benign and malicious behavior of sensors thsense utilizes three different machine learning-based detection mechanisms (i e markov chain naive bayes and lmt) to detect malicious behavior associated with sensors we implemented thsense on a sensor-rich android smart device (i e smartphone) and collected data from typical daily activities of real users furthermore we evaluated the performance of thsense against three sensor-based threats ( ) a malicious app that can be triggered via a sensor (e g light) ( ) a malicious app that can leak information via a sensor and ( ) a malicious app that can steal data using sensors our extensive evaluations show that the thsense framework is an effective and practical approach to defeat growing sensor-based threats with an accuracy above % without compromising the normal functionality of the device moreover our framework costs minimal overhead by the usenix association all rights reserved

    android-based internet-of-things devices with excellent compatibility and openness are constantly emerging a typical example is android things that google supports compatibility based on the same platform can provide more convenient personalization services centering on mobile devices while this uniformity-based computing environment can expose many security vulnerabilities for example new mobile malware running on android can instantly transition to all connected devices in particular the android platform has a structural weakness that makes it easy to repackage applications this can lead to malicious behavior to protect mobile apps that are vulnerable to malicious activity various code obfuscation techniques are applied to key logic the most effective one of this kind involves safely concealing application programming interfaces (api) it is very important to ensure that obfuscation is applied to the appropriate api with an adequate degree of resistance to reverse engineering because there is no objective evaluation method it depends on the developer judgment therefore in this paper we propose a scheme that can quantitatively evaluate the level of hiding of apis which represent the function of the android application based on machine learning theory to perform the quantitative evaluation the api information is obtained by static analysis of a dex file and the api-called code executed in dalvik in the android platform is dynamically extracted moreover the sensitive apis are classified using the extracted api and naive bayes classification the proposed scheme yields a high score according to the level of hiding of the classified api we tested the proposed scheme on representative applications of the google play store we believe it can be used as a model for obfuscation assessment schemes because it can evaluate the level of obfuscation in general without relying on specific obfuscation tools ieee 
    in the problem of learning with label proportions (also known as the problem of estimating class ratios) the training data is unlabeled and only the proportions of examples receiving each label are given the goal is to learn a hypothesis that predicts the proportions of labels on the distribution underlying the sample this model of learning is useful in a wide variety of settings including predicting the number of votes for candidates in political elections from polls in this paper we resolve foundational questions regarding the computational complexity of learning in this setting we formalize a simple version of the setting and we compare the computational complexity of learning in this model to classical pac learning perhaps surprisingly we show that what can be learned efficiently in this model is a strict subset of what may be leaned efficiently in pac under standard complexity assumptions we give a characterization in terms of vc dimension and we show that there are non-trivial problems in this model that can be efficiently learned we also give an algorithm that demonstrates the feasibility of learning under well-behaved distributions 
    here are considered information and information growth in interactions of information processing systems (ips) information does not exist 'per se'-it is always stored in some information processing system (living system social system business system administrative government system etc ) all ips are finite and can be modelled as finite state machines (fsm) with memory they are connected with each other and interact-exchange messages their messages (responses to input queries) reveal to others information about their functioning thus ips with more memory learn behaviour i e infer information stored in other smaller ips thus information in network of connected ips-s is accumulating in ips with more memory and smaller ips become parts of all greater and greater 'super' ips-ips on the next level of ips development hierarchy the whole human society is currently moving into new era-the era of networked super information processing systems where main value is information not material things the material goods based exchange value-money is replaced by digital currencies which are based on computer-generated informational structures but the rules and practices to handle all the time growing informational values are still from era of material values we do not yet have culture for information era thus malware and information theft are growing exponentially and this may essentially change our ownership and market-based societal organization the authors and ios press

    new emerging devices open up immense opportunities for everyday users at the same time they may raise significant security and privacy threats one such device forming the central focus of this work is an eeg headset which allows a user to control her computer only using her thoughts in this paper we show how such a malicious eeg device or a malicious application having access to eeg signals recorded by the device can be turned into a new form of a keylogger called peep that passively eavesdrops over users sensitive typed input specifically numeric pins and textual passwords by analyzing the corresponding neural signals peep works because users input is correlated with users innate visual processing as well as hand eye and head muscle movements all of which are explicitly or implicitly captured by the eeg device our contributions are two-fold first we design and develop peep against a commodity eeg headset and a higher-end medical-scale eeg device based on machine learning techniques second we conduct the comprehensive evaluation with multiple users to demonstrate the feasibility of peep for inferring pins and passwords as they are typed on a physical keyboard a virtual keyboard and an atm-style numeric keypad our results show that peep can extract sensitive input with an accuracy significantly higher than a random guessing classifier compared to prior work on this subject peep is highly surreptitious as it only requires passive monitoring of brain signals not deliberate and active strategies that may trigger suspicion and be detected by the user also peep achieves orders of magnitude higher accuracies compared to prior active pin inferring attacks our work serves to raise awareness to a potentially hard-to-address threat arising from eeg devices which may remain attached to the users almost invariably soon international financial cryptography association 
    wireless sensor networks (wsns) are autonomous self-configured and consist of distributed sensors for monitoring any physical or environmental conditions sensor nodes cooperatively disseminate their data through the network to a base station in recent years such networks have shown its wide applicability in various areas generally sensor nodes are small cost-effective memory constrained and having limited processing capabilities for sensing data in any particular region from the environment energy is one of the significant factors in such network whole network lifetime depends on how efficiently consumption of energy takes place sensor nodes are combined into groups which is called cluster the purpose of clustering approach is to make the consumption of energy in more effective way a cluster head node is used for collecting sensed data from cluster nodes for transmitting to the base station an efficient election of cluster head minimizes energy consumption thereby increasing network lifetime one major drawback in dynamic clustering approach is that in every round cluster head selection is done locally and decides the cluster region this process has extra communication cost in massage exchange to select the appropriate cluster head transmission of message from one node to another node consumes energy that leads to inefficient use of energy resource in this paper a non-probabilistic grid-based approach to prolong the wsns lifetime using fuzzy logic has been proposed in this whole network is divided into predefined grid area and selecting a node as grid head (gh) using two fuzzy variables viz base station distance and residual energy of sensor nodes this approach uses a multi-hop communication approach gh nodes are authorized to communicate with other gh nodes and base station simulation results show that the proposed approach prolongs wsns network lifetime than existing ones springer science business media singapore 
    a task of water supply systems is to provide safe drinking water to every customer which is a basic human need aging of water supply networks and increased precaution of terrorism risks led to re-evaluation of drinking water supply system reliability and vulnerability to accidental and intentional contamination contamination of drinking water can cause health social psychological and economic issues during the last decade early warning systems (ews) were often used to ensure the safety of drinking water ews are driven by conventional sets of drinking water quality sensors and the collected data are analyzed in real time for detection of contamination events numbers of algorithms have been developed most of the algorithms are based on statistical analysis or machine learning the aim of this study was to compare existing methods and to identify the method which is suitable for contamination detection in drinking water from non-compound specific sensors and requires relatively low computational resource a detailed review of different algorithms was presented in the current study with the primary focus on detection probability cluster analysis in combination with mahalanobis distances of feature vectors and canonical correlation analysis (cca) approach were selected as the most promising methods for application in a new generation of ews to detect and classify possible contamination events and agents while canonical correlation analysis method was the most accurate for detection of contamination events an advantage of mahalanobis distances was that it not only detects the contamination events but also could identify the type of contaminant in this study we conclude that cca and mahalanobis distance methods might be applied for detection of contamination events with relatively high and reliable precision rezekne academy of technologies rezekne 
    generally the decision rule for classifying unstructured data in an artificial neural network system depends on the sequence results of an activation function determined by vectormatrix multiplication between the input bias signal and the analog synaptic weight quantity of each node in a matrix array although a sequence-based decision rule can efficiently extract a common feature in a large data set in a short time it can occasionally fail to classify similar species because it does not intrinsically consider other quantitative configurations of the activation function that affect the synaptic weight update in this work we implemented a simple run-off election-based decision rule via an additional filter evaluation to mitigate the confusion from proximity of output activation functions enabling the improved training and inference performance of artificial neural network system using the filter evaluation selected via the difference among common features of classified images the recognition accuracy achieved for three types of shoe image data sets reached ~ % outperforming the maximum accuracy of ~ % obtained via the sequence-based decision rule in a fully connected single layer network this training algorithm with an independent filter can precisely supply the output class in the decision step of the fully connected network the author(s)

    popular social media networks provide the perfect environment to study the opinions and attitudes expressed by users while interactions in social media such as twitter occur in many natural languages research on stance detection (the position or attitude expressed with respect to a specific topic) within the natural language processing field has largely been done for english although some efforts have recently been made to develop annotated data in other languages there is a telling lack of resources to facilitate multilingual and crosslingual research on stance detection this is partially due to the fact that manually annotating a corpus of social media texts is a difficult slow and costly process furthermore as stance is a highly domain- and topic-specific phenomenon the need for annotated data is specially demanding as a result most of the manually labeled resources are hindered by their relatively small size and skewed class distribution this paper presents a method to obtain multilingual datasets for stance detection in twitter instead of manually annotating on a per tweet basis we leverage user-based information to semi-automatically label large amounts of tweets empirical monolingual and cross-lingual experimentation and qualitative analysis show that our method helps to overcome the aforementioned difficulties to build large balanced and multilingual labeled corpora we believe that our method can be easily adapted to easily generate labeled social media data for other natural language processing tasks and domains elsevier ltd
    with the advent of smart phones the popularity of free android applications has risen rapidly this has led to malicious android apps being involuntarily installed which violate the user privacy or conduct attack malware detection on android platforms therefore is a growing concern because of the undesirable similarity between malicious behavior and benign behavior which can lead to slow detection and allow compromises to persist for comparatively long periods of time in infected phones the contributions of this paper are first a multiple dimensional kernel feature-based framework and feature weight-based detection (wbd) designed to categorize and comprehend the characteristics of android malware and benign apps furthermore our software agent is orchestrated and implemented for the data collection and storage to scan thousands of benign and malicious apps automatically we examine kernel attributes of executing the task data structure in the android system and evaluate the detection accuracy with a number of datasets of various dimensions we find that memory- and signal-related features contribute to more precise classification than schedule-related and other descriptors of task states listed in our paper particularly memory-related features provide fine-grain classification policies for preserving higher classification precision than the signal-related and others furthermore we study and evaluate newly infected attributes of the android kernel task structure prioritizing the features of most significance based on dimensional reduction to optimize the efficiency of high-dimensional classification our second contribution is that our experiments demonstrate that as compared to existing techniques with a short list of task structure features ( or features) our method can achieve % % accuracy and % % false positive rate while detecting malware apps with reduced-dimensional features that adequately abbreviate online malware detections and advance offline malware inspections elsevier b v

    there is an abundance of misinformation disinformation and fake news related to covid- leading the director-general of the world health organization to term this an infodemic given the high volume of covid- content on the internet many find it difficult to evaluate veracity vulnerable and marginalized groups are being misinformed and subject to high levels of stress riots and panic buying have also taken place due to fake news however individual research-led websites can make a major difference in terms of providing accurate information for example the johns hopkins coronavirus resource center website has over million entries linked to it on google with the outbreak of covid- and the knowledge that deceptive news has the potential to measurably affect the beliefs of the public new strategies are needed to prevent the spread of misinformation this study seeks to make a timely intervention to the information landscape through a covid- fake news misinformation and disinformation website in this article we introduce coverifi a web application which combines both the power of machine learning and the power of human feedback to assess the credibility of news by allowing users the ability to vote on news content the coverifi platform will allow us to release labelled data as open source which will enable further research on preventing the spread of covid- -related misinformation we discuss the development of coverifi and the potential utility of deploying the system at scale for combating the covid- infodemic elsevier b v 
    behavior of malware varies depending the malware types which affects the strategies of the system protection software many malware classification models empowered by machine and or deep learning achieve superior accuracies for predicting malware types machine learning-based models need to do heavy feature engineering work which affects the performance of the models greatly on the other hand deep learning-based models require less effort in feature engineering when compared to that of the machine learning-based models however traditional deep learning architectures components such as max and average pooling cause architecture to be more complex and the models to be more sensitive to data the capsule network architectures on the other hand reduce the aforementioned complexities by eliminating the pooling components additionally capsule network architectures based models are less sensitive to data unlike the classical convolutional neural network architectures this paper proposes an ensemble capsule network model based on the bootstrap aggregating technique the proposed method is tested on two widely used highly imbalanced datasets (malimg and big) for which the-state-of-the-art results are well-known and can be used for comparison purposes the proposed model achieves the highest f-score which is for the big dataset and f-score which is for the malimg dataset our model also reaches the-state-of-the-art using % lower the number of trainable parameters than the best model in the literature elsevier ltd
    security of information passing through the internet is threatened by today's most advanced malware ranging from orchestrated botnets to simpler polymorphic worms these threats as examples of zero-day attacks are able to change their behavior several times in the early phases of their existence to bypass the network intrusion detection systems (nids) in fact even well-designed and frequently-updated signature-based nids cannot detect the zero-day treats due to the lack of an adequate signature database adaptive to intelligent attacks on the internet more importantly having an nids it should be tested on malicious traffic dataset that not only represents known attacks but also can to some extent reflect the characteristics of unknown zero-day attacks generating such traffic is identified in the literature as one of the main obstacles for evaluating the effectiveness of nids to address these issues we introduce rnnids that applies recurrent neural networks (rnns) to find complex patterns in attacks and generate similar ones in this regard for the first time we demonstrate that rnns are helpful to generate new unseen mutants of attacks as well as synthetic signatures from the most advanced malware to improve the intrusion detection rate besides to further enhance the design of an nids rnns can be employed to generate malicious datasets containing e g unseen mutants of a malware to evaluate the feasibility of our approaches we conduct extensive experiments by incorporating publicly available datasets where we show a considerable improvement in the detection rate of an off-the-shelf nids (up to %) elsevier ltd
    fact-checking has always been a central task of journalism but given the ever-growing amount and speed of news offline and online as well as the growing amounts of misinformation and disinformation it is becoming increasingly important to support human fact-checkers with (semi-)automated methods to make their work more efficient within fact-checking the detection of check-worthy claims is a crucial initial step since it limits the number of claims that require or deserve to be checked for their truthfulness in this paper we present factrank a novel claim detection tool for journalists specifically created for the dutch language to the best of our knowledge this is the first and still the only such tool for dutch factrank thus complements existing online claim detection tools for english and (a small number of) other languages factrank performs similarly to claim detection in claimbuster the state-of-the-art fact-checking tool for english our comparisons with a human baseline also indicate that given how much even expert human fact-checkers disagree there may be a natural upper bound on the accuracy of check-worthiness detection by machine-learning methods the specific quality of factrank derives from the interdisciplinary and iterative process in which it was created which includes not only a high-performance deep-learning neural network architecture but also a principled approach to defining and operationalising the concept of check-worthiness via a detailed codebook this codebook was created jointly by expert fact-checkers from the two countries that have dutch as an official language (belgium flanders and the netherlands) we expect factrank to be very useful exactly because of the way we defined check-worthiness and because of how we have made this explicit and traceable

    understanding how information propagates in real-life complex networks yields a better understanding of dynamical processes such as misinformation or epidemic spreading with the recent resurgence of graph neural networks as a powerful predictive methodology many network properties can be studied in terms of their predictability and as such offer a novel view on the studied process with the direct application of fast predictions that are complementary to resource-intensive simulations we investigated whether graph neural networks can be used to predict the effect of an epidemic should it start from a given individual (patient zero) we reformulate this problem as node regression and demonstrate the high utility of network-based machine learning for a better understanding of the spreading effects by being able to predict the effect of a given individual being the patient zero the proposed approach offers potentially orders of magnitude faster risk assessment and potentially aids the adopted epidemic spreading analysis techniques the author(s) under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag 
    in recent times the reach and influence of social media have grown tremendously across the entire globe the ease of access simplicity publicity and reach offered by giant social networking sites have come to hold immense value nowadays however this has led to the widespread use of fake accounts or programmed bots in order to inflate ones social media popularity and further spread favourable content many recent studies have highlighted the impact of such bots in fields like advertising commercial promotion and even elections in this paper we propose a method to detect bots on social networking sites and distinguish them from genuine user accounts by using a stacked learning approach whereby a convolutional neural network model is trained to feed forward to a machine learning model this is achieved by using a supervised learning approach to build a layered classifier that makes predictions based on a users profile information tweets and activity information from a dataset of twitter users our paper also analyses the comparative performance of many machine learning models applied to this problem the editor(s) (if applicable) and the author(s) under exclusive license to springer nature singapore pte ltd 
    in this paper we propose an original deep learning framework for malware classifying based on the malware behavior data currently machine learning techniques are becoming popular for classifying malware however most of the existing machine learning methods for malware classifying use shallow learning algorithms such as support vector machine decision trees random forest and naive bayes recently a deep learning approach has shown superior performance compared to traditional machine learning algorithms especially in tasks such as image classification in this paper we present the approach in which malware binaries are converted to a grayscale image specifically data in the raw form are converted into a d decimal valued matrix to represent an image we propose here an original dnn architecture with deep denoising autoencoder for feature compression since the autoencoder is much more advantageous due to the ability to model complex nonlinear functions compared to principal component analysis (pca) which is restricted to a linear map the compressed malware features are then classified with a deep neural network preliminary test results are quite promising with % classification accuracy on a malware database of samples with six different families of malware compared to svm and random forest algorithms the editor(s) (if applicable) and the author(s) under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag

    filtering vetting and verifying digital information is an area of core interest in information science online fake news is a specific type of digital misinformation that poses serious threats to democratic institutions misguides the public and can lead to radicalization and violence hence fake news detection is an important problem for information science research while there have been multiple attempts to identify fake news most of such efforts have focused on a single modality (e g only text-based or only visual features) however news articles are increasingly framed as multimodal news stories and hence in this work we propose a multimodal approach combining text and visual analysis of online news stories to automatically detect fake news drawing on key theories of information processing and presentation we identify multiple text and visual features that are associated with fake or credible news articles we then perform a predictive analysis to detect features most strongly associated with fake news next we combine these features in predictive models using multiple machine-learning techniques the experimental results indicate that a multimodal approach outperforms single-modality approaches allowing for better fake news detection association for information science and technology
    currently android malware detection is mostly performed on server side against the increasing number of malware powerful computing resource provides more exhaustive protection for app markets than maintaining detection by a single user however apart from the applications (apps) provided by the official market (i e google play store) apps from unofficial markets and third-party resources are always causing serious security threats to end-users meanwhile it is a time-consuming task if the app is downloaded first and then uploaded to the server side for detection because the network transmission has a lot of overhead in addition the uploading process also suffers from the security threats of attackers consequently a last line of defense on mobile devices is necessary and much-needed in this paper we propose an effective android malware detection system mobitive leveraging customized deep neural networks to provide a real-time and responsive detection environment on mobile devices mobitive is a pre-installed solution rather than an app scanning and monitoring engine using after installation which is more practical and secure although a deep learning-based approach can be maintained on server side efficiently for malware detection original deep learning models cannot be directly deployed and executed on mobile devices due to various performance limitations such as computation power memory size and energy therefore we evaluate and investigate the following key points ( ) the performance of different feature extraction methods based on source code or binary code ( ) the performance of different feature type selections for deep learning on mobile devices ( ) the detection accuracy of different deep neural networks on mobile devices ( ) the real-time detection performance and accuracy on different mobile devices ( ) the potential based on the evolution trend of mobile devices' specifications and finally we further propose a practical solution (mobitive) to detect android malware on mobile devices - ieee

    in recent years widespread rumors and fake news has given rise to many social and political problems most of the information today is acquired from digital sources in digital media it is difficult to assign accountability to the opinion due to which the data received cannot be authenticated lack of constant supervision has motivated the miscreants to spread fake information fake news articles that are planted over digital media shares important linguistic features such as immoderate usage of unconfirmed hyperbole and non-verified quotes it is necessary to invent an automated mechanism to identify fake news and also to minimize its impact by restricting its spread this survey comprehensively and systematically studies different methodologies in the detection of fake news in digital media the survey identifies and specifies fundamental theories in machine learning to facilitate and enhance the research of fake news detection by understanding the different methodologies in fake news studies we highlight some potential research gaps at the end of this survey the editor(s) (if applicable) and the author(s) under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag 
    research typically presumes that people believe misinformation and propagate it through their social networks yet a wide range of motivations for sharing misinformation might impact its spread as well as peoples belief of it by exam-ining research on motivations for sharing news information generally and misinformation specifically we derive a range of motivations that broaden current understandings of the sharing of misinformation to include factors that may to some extent mitigate the presumed dangers of misinformation for society to illustrate the utility of our viewpoint we report data from a preliminary study of peoples dis belief reactions to misinformation shared on social media using natural language processing analyses of over million comments demonstrate that misinformation on social media is often disbelieved these insights are leveraged to propose directions for future research that incorporate a more inclusive understanding of the various motivations and strategies for sharing misinformation socially in large-scale online networks by the authors licensee cogitatio (lisbon portugal)

    electoral violence is conceived of as violence that occurs contemporaneously with elections and as violence that would not have occurred in the absence of an election while measuring the temporal aspect of this phenomenon is straightforward measuring whether occurrences of violence are truly related to elections is more difficult using machine learning we measure electoral violence across three elections using disaggregated reporting in social media we demonstrate that our methodology is more than percent more accurate in measuring electoral violence than previously utilized models additionally we show that our measures of electoral violence conform to theoretical expectations of this conflict more so than those that exist in event datasets commonly utilized to measure electoral violence including acled icews and scad finally we demonstrate the validity of our data by developing a qualitative coding ontology the european political science association 
    simple transparent rules are often frowned upon while complex black-box models are seen as holding greater promise yet in quickly changing situations simple rules can protect against overfitting and adapt quickly we show that the surprisingly simple recency heuristic forecasts more accurately than google flu trends (gft) which used big data analytics and a black-box algorithm this heuristic predicts that this week's proportion of flu-related doctor visits equals the proportion from the most recent week it is based on psychological theory of how people deal with rapidly changing situations other theory-inspired heuristics have outperformed big data models in predicting outcomes such as u s presidential elections or other uncertain events such as consumer purchases patient hospitalizations and terrorist attacks heuristics are transparent clearly communicating the underlying rationale for their predictions we advocate taking into account psychological principles that have evolved over millennia and using these as a benchmark when testing big data models international institute of forecasters
    recently the emergence of the new malware has caused a major threat especially in finance sector in which many of the online banking data was stolen by the adversaries the malware threats information needs to be collected immediately after its outbreak early detection can save others from being the victims unfortunately there is time delay to get the new malware information into the malware database such as exploitdb a pre-emptive way needs to be taken to gather the first-hand information of the new malware as a preventive measure one of the methods is by extracting information from open source data such as online news by using named entity recognition (ner) however the existing ner system is incapable to extract the domain specific entities from the online news accurately the aim of this paper is to extract the malware entities and its behaviour attributes using extended version of ner with hmm and crf a malware annotated corpus is produced in order to conduct the supervise learning for the machine learning approach of the name entity tagger the results show crf performs slightly better than hmm few experiments are performed in order to optimize the performance of crf in terms of feature extraction finally the malware behaviour information is visualized onto a dashboard by combining few statistical graphs using matplotlib the purpose of visualizing the malware behaviour profile extracted from the online news is to help cyber security experts to better understand the malware behaviour the editor(s) (if applicable) and the author(s) under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag

    complexity of voting manipulation is a prominent topic in computational social choice in this work we consider a two-stage voting manipulation scenario first a malicious party (an attacker) attempts to manipulate the election outcome in favor of a preferred candidate by changing the vote counts in some of the voting districts afterwards another party (a defender) which cares about the voters' wishes demands a recount in a subset of the manipulated districts restoring their vote counts to their original values we investigate the resulting stackelberg game for the case where votes are aggregated using two variants of the plurality rule and obtain an almost complete picture of the complexity landscape both from the attacker's and from the defender's perspective elsevier b v 
    with the rapid evolution of the industrial internet cloud service has emerged as a next-generation industrial standard that has the potential to revolutionize and transform the enterprise industry in recent years numerous enterprises have acknowledged the benefits of cloud-based service models however the security issues are a major concern such as stealthy malware attacks against virtual domains in this paper we propose an introspection based security approach called vmshield for securing virtual domains in cloud based service platform which is designed to detect malware in cloud infrastructure vmshield performs virtual memory introspection from the hypervisor (trusteddomain) to collect the run-time behavior of processes making it impossible for the malware to evade the security tool the use of introspection makes the proposed approach better choice over traditional static and dynamic state-of-the-art techniques which fail to detect stealthy attacks the vmshield extracts the system call features using bag of n-gram approach and selects important features using the meta-heuristic algorithm binary particle swarm optimization (bpso) random forest (rf) classifier is used to classify the monitored programs into benign and malign processes making it capable of detecting the variants of malware thus an advantage over typical signature-matching approach the university of new mexico (unm) dataset and bare cloud dataset (university of california) have been used for the demonstration and validation of vmshield the results prove that vmshield achieves higher attack detection rate and reduced storage compared to previously proposed techniques ieee

    to what extent did online hate speech and white nationalist rhetoric on twitter increase over the course of donald trump's presidential election campaign and its immediate aftermath? the prevailing narrative suggests that trump's political rise - and his unexpected victory - lent legitimacy to and popularized bigoted rhetoric that was once relegated to the dark corners of the internet however our analysis of over million tweets related to the election in addition to almost million tweets from a random sample of american twitter users provides systematic evidence that hate speech did not increase on twitter over this period using both machine-learning-augmented dictionary-based methods and a novel classification approach leveraging data from reddit communities associated with the alt-right movement we observe no persistent increase in hate speech or white nationalist language either over the course of the campaign or in the six months following trump's election while key campaign events and policy announcements produced brief spikes in hateful language these bursts quickly dissipated overall we find no empirical support for the proposition that trump's divisive campaign or election increased hate speech on twitter a a siegel et al

    the android operating system is one of the most used operating systems in the world and has become a target to malware authors traditional malware detection methods such as signatures find it impossible to deal with detecting complex and intelligent malware which are capable of obfuscating and repackaging to avoid being detected there is therefore an increase in the need to have more efficient and intelligent forms of malware detection artificial intelligence has now been brought to the field of malware detection and classification due to its accuracy and intelligence it has become an ideal solution to bridge the gap between traditional classifiers and the intelligent malware currently research is mainly being conducted using either machine learning or deep learning techniques to target all or a given malware family this paper proposes a methodology which brings an ensemble solution between the support vector machine algorithm and the convolutional neural network to create a solution that provides a higher accuracy than available techniques ieee 
    modern malware evolves various detection avoidance techniques to bypass the state-of-the-art detection methods an emerging trend to deal with this issue is the combination of image transformation and machine learning techniques to classify and detect malware however existing works in this field only perform simple image transformation methods that limit the accuracy of the detection in this paper we introduce a novel approach to classify malware by using a deep network on images transformed from binary samples in particular we first develop a novel hybrid image transformation method to convert binaries into color images that convey the binary semantics the images are trained by a deep convolutional neural network that later classifies the test inputs into benign or malicious categories through the extensive experiments our proposed method surpasses all baselines and achieves % in terms of accuracy on the testing set ieee 
    google announced that they are billion active android users in the world there are different categories of mobile apps available based on development nature and different categories for example apps based on development nature are native apps hybrid apps web apps and apps based on different categories are gaming business educational lifestyle entertainment and utility etc due to its scalable growing and open source nature it is easily vulnerable to hackers or attackers to steal our information and inject malware apps into our mobile system in recent days a new malware app called joker was introduced in the mobile market and infected apps in the google store which mainly focus on extracting money and credential information from the users without their knowledge many scientific researches are undergoing to identify android malicious apps using machine learning classification approach in this paper the deep neural network algorithm is chosen to detect android malware by extracting features from the android manifest file and java api modules then fed into deep neural network (dnn) [ ] classifier to detect whether the apps as malicious or benign app this paper combines the sigpid [ ] (significant permission identification) technique which is given as a feature in multimodal dnn sigpid was evaluated as a high probability of detecting malware apps using permissions the goal is to implement an efficient framework for detecting the android malware apps using machine learning techniques which can be used in app store where all the applications are deployed in cloud and also in mobile antivirus app to detect the harmfulness of the app ieee 
    successful malware attacks on information technology systems can cause millions of dollars in damage the exposure of sensitive and private information and the irreversible destruction of data anti-virus systems that analyze a file's contents use a combination of static and dynamic analysis to detect and remove remediate such malware however examining a file's entire contents is not always possible in practice as the volume and velocity of incoming data may be too high or access to the underlying file contents may be restricted or unavailable if it were possible to obtain estimates of a file's relative likelihood of being malicious without looking at the file contents we could better prioritize file processing order and aid analysts in situations where a file is unavailable in this work we demonstrate that file names can contain information predictive of the presence of malware in a file in particular we show the effectiveness of a character-level convolutional neural network at predicting malware status using file names on endgame's ember malware detection benchmark dataset ieee 
    there has been an increased interest in the application of convolutional neural networks for image based malware classification but the susceptibility of neural networks to adversarial examples allows malicious actors to evade classifiers adversarial examples are usually generated by adding small perturbations to the input that are unrecognizable to humans but the same approach is not effective with malware in general these perturbations cause changes in the byte sequences that change the initial functionality or result in un-executable binaries we present a generative model for executable adversarial malware examples using obfuscation that achieves a high misclassification rate up to % and % in white-box and black-box settings respectively and demonstrates transferability we further evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by reporting insignificant change in the evasion rate of our adversarial examples against popular defense strategies ieee 
    a malware is a computer program which harms the computer in which it gets executed malware analysis plays a major role in analysing the functionalities and behaviour of the malware malware analysis is a slow and tedious process which involves a lot of manual work finding the type of the malware will often boost up the analysis process and helps to the researcher to know what the binary executable is capable of usually researchers perform various static analysis techniques to find the category of the malware using various tools like strings dependency walker etc classifying them manually is a non-feasible solution so in this paper we are proposing an automated approach for malware classification using deep neural networks ieee 
    big data and cloud computing technology appeared on the scene as new trends due to the rapid growth of social media usage over the last decade big data represent the immense volume of complex data that show more details about behaviours activities and events that occur around the world as a result big data analytics needs to access diverse types of resources within a decreased response time to produce accurate and stable business experimentation that could help make brilliant decisions for organizations in real-time these developments have spurred a revolutionary transformation in research inventions and business marketing user behaviour analysis for classification and prediction is one of the hottest topics in data science this type of analysis is performed for several purposes such as finding users interests about a product (for marketing e-commerce etc ) or toward an event (elections championships etc ) and observing suspicious activities (security and privacy) based on their traits over the internet in this paper a neuro-fuzzy approach for the classification and prediction of user behaviour is proposed a dataset composed of users temporal logs containing three types of information namely local machine network and web usage logs is targeted to complement the analysis each users -degree feedback is also utilized various rules have been implemented to address the companys policy for determining the precise behaviour of a user which could be helpful in managerial decisions for prediction a gaussian radial basis function neural network (grbf-nn) is trained based on the example set generated by a fuzzy rule based system (frbs) and the -degree feedback of the user the results are obtained and compared with other state-of-the-art schemes in the literature and the scheme is found to be promising in terms of classification as well as prediction accuracy the author(s) 
    fake news has been generated and widely spread although journalists and researchers created fact-checking websites (e g snopes and politifact) and analyzed characteristics of fake news to fill this gap in this paper we focus on developing machine learning models based on only text information in news articles toward automatically detecting fake news in particular we proposed a framework which extracts features and builds traditional known machine learning models like random forest and xgboost we also propose a deep learning based model (lstm with self-attention mechanism) to see which one performs better in the fake news article detection in both political news and celebrity news domains in the experiments we compare our models against baselines the results show that our xgboost model improved % and % over the best baseline in terms of accuracy in both political news articles and celebrity news articles respectively ieee 
    existing anti-virus software and malware detection methods including signature-based and the machine learning-based malware detection methods are unable to update the virus database in real time resulting in poor resistance to malware variants to solve this problem this paper proposes a novel malware detection method based on deep reinforcement learning which combines the advantages of q-learning and neural network q-learning action selection strategy is adopted while solving the problem of high dimensional state space theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed method can not only detect malware variants efficiently but also perform well in many well-known anti-virus software which is a new direction in the field of malware detection ieee 
    in the present memory forensics has captured the world's attention currently the volatility framework is used to extract artifacts from the memory dump and the extracted artifacts are then used to investigate and to identify the malicious processes in the memory dump the investigation process must be conducted manually since the volatility framework provides only the artifacts that exist in the memory dump in this paper we investigate the four predominant domains of registry dll api calls and network connections in memory forensics to implement the system 'malfore ' which helps automate the entire process of memory forensics we use the cuckoo sandbox to analyze malware samples and to obtain memory dumps and volatility frameworks to extract artifacts from the memory dump the finalized dataset was evaluated using several machine learning algorithms including rnn the highest accuracy achieved was % and it was reached using a recurrent neural network model fitted to the data extracted from the dll artifacts and % accuracy was reached using a recurrent neural network model fitted to data extracted from the network connection artifacts ieee 
    malware detection and classification has enticed a lot of researchers in the past decades several mechanisms based on machine learning (ml) computer vision and deep learning have been deployed to this task and have achieved considerable results however advanced malware (stealthy malware) generated using various obfuscation techniques like code relocation code transposition polymorphism and mutation thwart the detection in this paper we propose a two-pronged technique which can efficiently detect both traditional and stealthy malware firstly we extract the microarchitectural traces procured while executing the application which are fed to the traditional ml classifiers to identify malware spawned as separate thread in parallel for an efficient stealthy malware detection we instigate an automated localized feature extraction technique that will be used as an input to recurrent neural networks (rnns) for classification we have tested the proposed mechanism rigorously on stealthy malware created using code relocation obfuscation technique with the proposed two-pronged approach an accuracy of % precision of % recall score of % and f- score of % is achieved furthermore the proposed technique attains up to % higher on average detection accuracy and precision along with % higher on average recall and f- score as compared to the cnn-based sequence classification and hidden markov model (hmm) based approaches in detecting stealthy malware ieee 
    the concept of a decoy process is a new development of defensive deception beyond traditional honeypots decoy processes can be exceptionally effective in detecting malware directly upon contact or by redirecting malware to decoy i o a key requirement is that they resemble their real counterparts very closely to withstand adversarial probes by threat actors to be usable decoy processes need to consume only a small fraction of the resources consumed by their real counterparts our contribution in this paper is twofold we attack the resource utilization consistency of decoy processes provided by a neural network with a heatmap training mechanism which we find to be insufficiently trained we then devise machine learning over control flow graphs that improves the heatmap training mechanism a neural network retrained by our work shows higher accuracy and defeats our attacks without a significant increase in its own resource utilization ieee 
    in this study we examine the impact of time on state-of-the-art news veracity classifiers we show that as time progresses classification performance for both unreliable and hyper-partisan news classification slowly degrade while this degradation does happen it happens slower than expected illustrating that hand-crafted content-based features such as style of writing are fairly robust to changes in the news cycle we show that this small degradation can bemitigated using online learning last we examine the impact of adversarial content manipulation by malicious news producers specifically we test three types of attack based on changes in the input space and data availability we show that static models are susceptible to content manipulation attacks but online models can recover from such attacks association for computing machinery

    fake news can confuse many people in the area of politics culture healthcare etc fake news refers to news containing misleading or fabricated contents that are actually groundless they are intentionally exaggerated or provide false information as such fake news can distort reality and cause social problems such as self-misdiagnosis of medical issues many academic researchers have been collecting data from social and medical media which are sources of various information flows and conducting studies to analyse and detect fake news however in the case of conventional studies the features used for analysis are limited and the consideration for newly added features of social media is lacking therefore this study proposes a fake news analysis modelling method by identifying a variety of features and collecting various data from twitter a social media outlet with a good deal of power in terms of spreading information the method proposed in this study can increase the accuracy of fake news analysis by acquiring more potential information from the quote retweet feature added to twitter in compared to the more conventional and common retweet only furthermore fake news was analysed through neural network-based classification modelling by using the preprocessed data and the identified best features in the learning data in the performance results using the neural network-based classifier the classification model that also used quote retweet showed an improvement in performance over the conventional methods and it was confirmed that the identified best features had a significant impact on increasing the classification accuracy of fake news by the authors licensee mdpi basel switzerland

    fully connected autonomous vehicles are more vulnerable than ever to hacking and data theft the controller area network (can) protocol is used for communication between in-vehicle control networks (ivn) the absence of basic security features of this protocol like message authentication makes it quite vulnerable to a wide range of attacks including spoofing attacks as traditional cybersecurity methods impose limitations in ensuring confidentiality and integrity of transmitted messages via can a new technique has emerged among others to approve its reliability in fully authenticating the can messages at the physical layer of the communication system the method of fingerprinting the messages is implemented to link the received signal to the transmitting electronic control unit (ecu) this paper introduces a new method to implement the security of modern electric vehicles the lumped element model is used to characterize the channel-specific step response ecu and channel imperfections lead to a unique transfer function for each transmitter due to the unique transfer function the step response for each transmitter is unique in this paper we use control system parameters as a feature-set afterward a neural network is used transmitting node identification for message authentication a dataset collected from a can network with eight-channel lengths and eight ecus to evaluate the performance of the suggested method detection results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of % of transmitter detection ieee 
    healthcare professionals are often the weakest link in the security chain which is contributing to data breaches in the healthcare sector a number of reasons account for this technological countermeasures for cyber defenses have been heightened and the adversaries tend to exploit easy entry points besides healthcare staffs are usually occupied by their core duty of healthcare provison with little experience in information security with a design science approach (dsa) observational measures for effective profiling of healthcare staffs were developed regulations and security standards such as the code of conduct general data protection regulation (gdpr) of european union (eu) iso and other norwegian acts and regulations for personal data protection were reviewed for the observational measures a comprehensive healthcare security practice analysis modeling and incentivization (hspami) framework was proposed for analyzing healthcare staffs' security practices in a comprehensive way ieee 
    while the exchange of data files or programs on the internet grows exponentially most users are vulnerable to infected files especially to malicious non-executables due to the circumstances between south and north korea many malicious actions have recently been found in hangulword processor (hwp) non-executable files because the hwp is widely used in schools military facilities and government institutions of south korea the hwp file usually has one or more byte streams that are often used for the malicious actions based on an assumption that infected byte streams have particular patterns we design a convolutional neural network (cnn) to grasp such patterns we conduct experiments on our prepared hwp files and demonstrate that the proposed cnn achieves the best performance compared to other machine learning models as new malicious attacks keep emerging we will keep collecting such hwp files and investigate better model structures by the authors licensee mdpi basel switzerland 
    security of the computer systems is the most important factor for single users and businesses because an attack on a system can cause data loss and considerable harm to the businesses due to the increment of the range of the cyber-attacks anti-virus scanners cannot fulfil the need for protection hence the increment of the skill level that required for the development of cyber threats and the availability of the attacking tools on the internet the need for artificial intelligence-based systems is a must to the users the proposed approach is an automated system that consists of a mechanism to deploy vulnerabilities and a rich database with known vulnerabilities the convolutional neural networks detects the vulnerabilities and the artificial intelligence-based generative models do the prevention process and improves reliability the prediction procedure implemented using the algorithm called 'time series' and the model called 'sarima' these implementations give an output with considerable accuracy ieee 
    age estimation from images of the face has gained more attention in recent as it is favorable in some realworld applications in this work we address the problem of under-age registration voting in nigeria electoral system which has been a major menace hindering a free and fair election in the country since the assumption of the democratic system of government to this end a pretrained vgg- deep convolutional neural network while comparing two optimization algorithms without image preprocessing is employed to both extract features from image(s) of prospective voters and classify same under the established age classification group as eligible or not to exercise their civil right in light of this a classification accuracy of % is achieved with the model ieee
