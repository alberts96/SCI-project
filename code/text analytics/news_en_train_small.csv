Fox News drops 'Fair and Balanced' slogan
June 14, 2017: 10:36 PM ET
How Trump-Murdoch ties may influence Fox probe
The Fox News Channel quietly dropped its ""Fair and Balanced"" slogan last year in an effort to move beyond the era of its former chairman and CEO, Roger Ailes.
In its place, producers have been asked to use the network's other slogan: ""Most Watched. Most Trusted"" -- a statement that is at least half true, insofar as Fox News maintains some of the highest ratings in cable news. The network may introduce a new slogan, a source there said.
Related: Murdoch ambitions hang in balance amid Fox News investigations
Ailes invented the ""Fair and Balanced"" slogan around the founding of Fox News in 1996. The slogan was less a statement of intent -- Fox News was from its inception a conservative network -- and more a message to Americans who had grown wary of what they saw as liberal bias in mainstream media. Here, the slogan seemed to say, was an alternative for non-liberal Americans.
Ailes resigned from Fox News last year amid sexual harassment allegations and died last month at the age of 77.
New York Magazine's Gabriel Sherman, an Ailes biographer, was first to report the news.
A Fox News spokesperson confirmed that the network had not used the slogan in external marketing or on-air promotions since August 2016, but said ""the shift has nothing to do with programming or editorial decisions.""
Sources at the network said there had been no official announcement regarding the change.

"UN commits to stop ocean plastic waste
BBC environment analyst, Nairobi
Nations have agreed that the world needs to completely stop plastic waste from entering the oceans.
The UN resolution, which is set to be sealed tomorrow, has no timetable and is not legally binding.
But ministers at an environment summit in Kenya believe it will set the course for much tougher policies and send a clear signal to business.
A stronger motion was rejected after the US would not agree to any specific, internationally agreed goals.
Under the proposal, governments would establish an international taskforce to advise on combating what the UN's oceans chief has described as a planetary crisis.
Environmentalists say ministers are starting to take plastic waste more seriously, but need to move much more quickly.
Li Lin from the green group WWF said: ""At last we are seeing some action on this issue, but we still don’t have the urgency we need. The problem needs solving right now.""
One contentious issue is the wish of delegates to include businesses on the global taskforce.
Ministers say the problem will not be solved without business, but green groups point out that some firms in the plastics industry have been lobbying against restrictions for decades.
Vidar Helgesen, Norway’s environment minister, a leading voice in the talks, told BBC News: ""Business is listening to markets and seeing how marine litter is a growing popular concern.
""It's possibly the fastest-growing environmental problem and it's therefore a fast-growing problem for business.
""We need to bring on board those companies that want to change things, then look at taxes and regulations to make more companies act sustainably.
""We also need to mobilise businesses like aquaculture that suffer from marine pollution.""
Certainly, there has been a flurry of resistance from plastics firms to the bans occurring across Africa.
One UN delegate, who did not want to be named, told me journalists in some countries were being paid by the plastics industry to write stories about job losses following the plastic bag ban.
Here in Kenya, a long newspaper report counted job losses from the sudden closure of a plastics plant. But it did not mention the jobs being created in alternatives, such as labour-intensive basketwork, which provides work for the rural poor.
But some governments are standing firm, and the meeting has witnessed individual nations declaring tougher action against single-use plastic bags on their own territory.
South Africa and Cameroon are the latest to declare a tax on the thin bags which strew Africa's fields and cities.
include Mauretania, Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Ghana, Kenya, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mauritius, Zanzibar and Uganda.
Bangladesh imposed a ban in 2002 after plastic bags blocked drains and contributed to major floods.
Sri Lanka and others adopted a ban for similar reasons, although in Mauretania a ban came because cattle were getting sick from eating plastic.
'Laggards versus progressives'
Whatever the motivation for restrictions, sea creatures will eventually benefit from a slackening in the tide of waste.
The UN's spokesman Sam Barratt told BBC News: ""Of course we would have liked to have gone further, but this meeting's made real progress.
""There's now a sense of urgency and energy behind the issue that we haven't quite seen before.
""What is obvious, though, is that the UN can't solve this problem on its own. We need to do it in partnership with governments, businesses and even individuals.""
Whilst the UN grinds slowly forward, one delegate told me the meeting had been really useful for ministers to share their experiences on action they had taken in their own countries. Laggards were learning from progressives, he said.
He highlighted collaborative action from states along Africa's Atlantic coast to clamp down on the waste that infests their seas. The UK may be brought into that partnership thanks to its British Overseas Territory of St Helena.

"Ford profits jump but China challenge remains
Ford has said it will focus on successful lines, including trucks
Strong pickup truck sales in North America boosted profits at Ford in the third quarter, but the US car maker still faces an uphill battle in China.
The firm had profits of $1.6bn (Â£1.2bn), up more than 60% compared to the same quarter last year, when a recall raised costs.
The gains in the US came despite a slowdown in sales of new cars there.
Ford has looked to strong demand for pickup trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUVs) to keep sales steady.
A large part of the company's profits came from its F-Series pickup trucks, which have been the best-selling vehicle in North America for decades.
Ford said the average transaction price for its trucks rose $2,800 to $45,400.
But the firm is feeling pressure to boost its share price, which has drifted lower in recent years.
Investors say Ford is behind when it comes to self driving car technology and has not made strong enough inroads in China - the world's largest vehicle market.
The firm said in September that it had sold about 833,000 vehicles in China in the first nine months of the year, down about 5% compared to the same period in 2016.
By contrast, rival General Motors and its joint venture partners sold more than 2.7m cars in the first nine months, up about 1%.
Ford told investors it sees ""enormous opportunities"" to improve its performance of its Asia Pacific division, including in China.
In August, Ford said it was exploring a joint venture with Zotye, a local firm focused on electric vehicles.
But it warned investors that competitive pressure to keep prices low in China and the rising cost of raw materials may limit profit margins in coming months.
Ford revenue in the three months to the end of September was $36.5bn, up 1% year-on-year.
Ford chief executive Jim Hackett, who was installed this spring, said the firm is investing in autonomous vehicles and will start to test-drive cars in some US cities next year.
Ford also is developing new business partnerships with unnamed companies to use its self-driving vehicles in commercial applications other than ride hailing, Hackett said.
He declined to confirm whether Ford still planned to put those vehicles into service by 2021, executives have said.
Rival General Motors Co said in recent weeks it plans to accelerate the commercial application of its self-driving Chevrolet Bolts, some of which could be in operation before 2020.
GM also plans to introduce 20 electric vehicles by 2023.
Shares in Ford rose 0.8% in morning trade after the results were released.

"Bereaved parents warn teenagers over meningitis risk
Emily Styles, with her mum Julia, had plans to become a special needs teacher
Parents who lost a teenager to meningitis are warning other parents to ensure their children are vaccinated against the disease.
The Men ACWY vaccine is offered free to all 17- and 18-year-olds and first-time university entrants under 25 because students are particularly at risk.
But only a third of young people get the life-saving vaccine, and cases of Men W are on the rise.
said it was ""deeply concerned"" about low vaccine uptake.
Julia Styles lost her daughter Emily at 19 as she was preparing to go to Winchester University.
She had been working as a teaching assistant and had plans to become a special needs teacher.
When she started feeling unwell, a few days after Christmas 2013, she was at her boyfriend's house. The following day when she tried to get up, she collapsed.
""There was no rash at any point. Even when Emily was unconscious, I still didn't think it was meningitis,"" Julia says.
Julia has decided to talk about the pain of her daughter's death, on New Year's Day 2014, to prevent similar tragedies happening to other families.
Emily died before the Men ACWY vaccine was introduced in the UK, in August 2015, which protects against the four groups of meningococcal bacteria: A, C, W and Y.
Emily Styles was a kind, thoughtful young woman who was much-loved
She wants parents to imagine exactly what she has gone through.
""There wasn't a vaccine then. I didn't have choice.
""I would say to parents now, 'Just imagine for a moment if your child walked out the door and the next time you saw then they were unconscious and then you were burying them,'"" Julia says.
She says the single most important thing parents can do is to make sure they get their children vaccinated.
""Do it while you're buying them the pots and pans and things they need for university.""
Meningitis can be difficult to spot because the symptoms are similar to common illnesses such as the flu or a hangover - but it can kill within hours and requires urgent medical treatment.
fever, cold hands and feet
refusing food and vomiting
Teenagers are the second most at-risk group for contracting meningitis, after babies and toddlers.
Up to a quarter of students carry the bacteria, and they tend to pass it on easily.
Living in close contact with other young people in university halls means students are far more likely to be infected if not protected by the vaccine.
Meningococcal bacteria are passed from person to person by coughing, sneezing and intimate kissing.
Dr Tom Nutt, chief executive at Meningitis Now, said: ""We remain deeply concerned about the low level of vaccine uptake - just 33% last year, which remains disappointingly below the 2015 uptake rate of 38%.
""It's vital that young people and their parents are not complacent about the threat of meningitis - we urge them to take up this lifesaving vaccine.""
Cases of meningococcal group W have been rising every year in the UK since 2009, with 210 in 2015-16 compared with 30 in 2011-12.
Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said the Men ACWY vaccination programme would ""save lives and prevent lifelong and devastating disability"".
""We have seen a rapid increase in Men W cases across England in recent years, and vaccination is the most effective way of protecting against infection.""
She urged teenagers and young people to get vaccinated as soon as possible and seek urgent medical help if they were concerned about their friends' health or their own.
Those who are due to leave school this summer, or who are aged 17 to 18 and not in school, are now eligible for the Men ACWY vaccine and should contact their GP practice.

"Self-assessment: concern over fewer ways to pay tax
Campaigners have raised concerns over a ban imposed by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on paying tax by credit card or via the Post Office.
About 11 million people complete a self-assessment tax return every year, with the deadline for online forms of 31 January approaching.
Many have to settle an income tax or capital gains tax bill.
Payments at the Post Office were banned in December and the credit card option will be cut from 13 January.
The Low Income Tax Reform Group (LITRG) said that it was concerned that some people would struggle to find a way to pay in time, and that some could resort to taking out high-interest loans as they could not pay by credit card.
""Making payments may not be straightforward for some taxpayers, and we are keen to see that these changes are publicised as widely as possible,"" said Anne Fairpo, who chairs LITRG.
""If making the tax payment will cause hardship, we strongly recommend people contact HMRC as soon as possible, and certainly before the due date of payment, to discuss their case.""
HMRC argues that letters have been sent as part of a marketing campaign signalling the changes.
Millions of people who have more than one source of income or are self-employed are required to file a tax return.
The tax due can still be paid by debit card, via a bank's BACS, CHAPS or Faster Payments system, or by setting up a direct debit.
Employed people who owe less than £3,000 on their tax bill can pay it through their subsequent PAYE system, but only if they submitted their return online by 30 December.
However, the credit card payment option - used in 454,000 cases in 2016-17 - has been withdrawn owing to imminent change in the law which bans surcharges on Visa, Mastercard and American Express payments.
HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has been charging up to 0.6% for payment by credit card, but would have had to foot the bill had it not banned this method of payment.
""It would be unfair to expect other taxpayers to pick up this cost,"" a spokesman for HMRC said.
The law change, prompting the change in the rules, comes just a few weeks before the self-assessment deadline.
The Transcash system, operated through the Post Office, was removed by operator Santander, the HMRC spokesman said. The tax authority was not the only user of the service and had no influence on this decision, he said.
HMRC has been running a relatively

"Radiohead on Israel gig: ""Playing a country isn't the same as endorsing its government""
The band have played in Israel six times - but not since calls for a cultural boycott were first made in 2005
Thom Yorke has continued to defend Radiohead's decision to play a concert in Israel.
The band have repeatedly been urged to call off the show as part of a cultural boycott over Israel's occupation of Gaza and the West Bank.
On Tuesday, filmmaker Ken Loach wrote an open letter, accusing Radiohead of ignoring ""human rights violations"".
, saying, ""Playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing its government"".
""We've played in Israel for over 20 years through a succession of governments, some more liberal than others.
""We don't endorse [Israeli Prime Minister] Netanyahu any more than Trump, but we still play in America.
""Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression.
""I hope that makes it clear Ken.""
, Loach rejected Yorke's previous assertion that he, and others, had failed to approach the band in person, before making accusations in public.
""I and others are still willing to meet Yorke and his colleagues, together with Palestinian artists,"" Loach said.
Ken Loach is one of the most vocal supporters of the cultural boycott
""Radiohead are important to a lot of people around the world, not just because they are accomplished and very distinguished musicians, but also because they are perceived to be a progressive political band.
""None of us want to see them make the mistake of appearing to endorse or cover up Israeli oppression. If they go to Tel Aviv, they may never live it down.""
Loach continued: ""I don't know who is advising Radiohead, but their stubborn refusal to engage with the many critics of their ill-advised concert in Tel Aviv suggests to me that they only want to hear one side - the one that supports apartheid.""
Radiohead have performed in Israel eight times - most recently in 2000 - but next week's show is the first time they've visited since the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement began in 2005.
The Tel Aviv gig is the last date on Radiohead's world tour
, who asked them to reconsider performing in a country ""where a system of apartheid has been imposed on the Palestinian people"".
Among the signatories were South African archbishop Desmond Tutu, Pink Floyd's Roger Water, actors Maxine Peake and Miriam Margolyes, and Mercury Prize-winners Young Fathers.
Responding to that letter, Yorke explained that he did not agree with the BDS movement.
""The kind of dialogue that they want to engage in is one that's black or white,""
. ""I have a problem with that.""
He added: ""The person who knows most about these things is [Radiohead guitarist] Jonny [Greenwood]. He has both Palestinian and Israeli friends and a wife who's an Arab Jew.
""All these people to stand there at a distance throwing stuff at us, waving flags, saying, 'You don't know anything about it!'. Imagine how offensive that is for Jonny.
""Part of me wants to say nothing because anything I say cooks up a fire from embers. But at the same time, if you want me to be honest, yeah, it's really upsetting that artists I respect think we are not capable of making a moral decision ourselves after all these years.
""They talk down to us and I just find it mind-boggling that they think they have the right to do that. It's extraordinary.""
Pro-Palestinian signs and flags were waved during Radiohead's TRNSMT show last Friday
The band faced further protests when they played the TRNSMT festival in Glasgow this weekend.
A small section of the crowd raised Palestinian flags during the band's headline set - their final UK show of the year.
Yorke was alleged to have sworn at the protest, muttering ""some people"", as the band played Myxomatosis.
As of now, Radiohead is still scheduled to perform the concert in Tel Aviv's Park Hayarkon on 19 July. They will be joined at the show by the Jewish-Arabic band Dudu Tassa & The Kuwaitis.

"Eurovision Song Contest: Australia through to final
Isaiah Firebrace scored Australia a place in the final
Australia will take part in the Eurovision Song Contest final for the third year running after making it through the first semi-final in Kiev.
Isaiah Firebrace progressed despite failing to hit a high note during his performance of Don't Come Easy.
Poland, Sweden and hotly tipped Portugal also made it through along with six other countries.
But Finland's Norma John made a surprise exit from the competition along with seven other acts.
The fates of the 18 countries involved were decided by a combination of votes from national juries and viewers.
Another 18 countries will take part in the second semi-final on Thursday ahead of the grand final on Saturday night.

Isaiah's vocal hiccup occurred near the end of his performance of his swooning ballad, the third competing song to be heard on Tuesday.
The 17-year-old indigenous Australian was one of the youngest performers on an evening that featured the usual Eurovision mix of kitsch, spectacle and questionable fashion choices.
Azerbaijan's Dihaj was joined on stage by a man on a ladder wearing a horse's head, while Moldovan trio Sunstroke Project were supported by three female singers in wedding gowns.
One of the warmest receptions of the night went to Portugal's Salvador Sobral, whose arrival in Ukraine this month was delayed by health problems.

Among the unsuccessful semi-finalists was Montenegro's Slavko Kalezic, whose four-foot man-braid had made him a favourite with many Eurovision fans.
Slovenia's Omar Naber, who represented his country the last time the contest was held in Kiev in 2005, was also sent packing.
The UK's hopes this year rest on Welsh singer Lucie Jones, who will perform her ballad Never Give Up on You during Saturday's final.
As one of the so-called ""big five"", the UK get an automatic pass through to the final along with four other countries and host nation Ukraine.

He and Toback also focus of Beverly Hills police investigations
Police in New York City and Beverly Hills say they are investigating claims against producer Harvey Weinstein and director James Toback.
There are two open New York Police Department investigations into Weinstein, based on accusers who say they were sexually assaulted, a law enforcement source told CNN.
One of the NYPD cases involves Lucia Evans, the source told CNN. Evans first spoke of her allegations against Weinstein
A second unnamed alleged victim has come forward through the NYPD's rape hotline with sexual assault allegations against Weinstein, the source added.
The NYPD said it received other calls into the rape hotline related to Weinstein and investigators are looking into those claims as well.
Weinstein has been accused by more than 60 women of harassment or sexual assault.
Through his spokesperson, Weinstein has repeatedly denied ""any allegations of non-consensual sex.""
Police in Beverly Hills, California are looking into complaints involving Weinstein and Toback, separately.
""These cases are under investigation and no further information will be released at this time,"" Beverly Hills police said in a statement.
allegations of sexual harassment by Toback, a screenwriter and director whose credits include ""The Pick-up Artist,"" and ""Bugsy.""
To date, more than 300 women have contacted the LA Times via email and phone calls to accuse Toback of inappropriate conduct,
Toback's agent, Jeff Berg, told CNN last week he would pass a request for a comment on to his client. Berg has since ceased representing Toback.
The director, 72, denied the allegations when contacted by the Times, the newspaper said.
Toback told the paper he had never met any of the women -- or if he did meet them, it ""was for five minutes and (he had) no recollection.""
He said that for the last 22 years, it was ""biologically impossible"" for him to take part in the behavior the women described in the article, saying he had diabetes and a heart condition requiring medication, the Los Angeles Times reported. He declined to elaborate.
Toback told the Times he had never met any of his accusers or if he had, it ""was for five minutes and (he had) no recollection.""

"Ultrasonic clothes dryer 'halves drying time'
A tumble dryer that is claimed to dry clothes twice as fast has been developed in the US.
The machine uses high-frequency sound waves instead of heat to dry laundry.
As well as speeding up the drying process, it is expected to use up to 70% less energy than conventional dryers.
The dryer has been developed by scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, in partnership with General Electric.
The inner lining of the drum of the machine is fitted with small sheets that convert an electric signal into vibrations.
These are at a high enough frequency that they can shake the water out of clothes, in the form of a cold mist.
The water is driven into the outer part of the drum, where it flows down to a collection tank.
According to the US Department of Energy, which supported the project, standard clothes dryers take an average of 50 minutes to dry a medium-sized load.
The prototype model can dry the same amount of laundry in about 20 minutes.
The research has been driven in part by the fact that the basic technology used in clothes dryers - heating the air to evaporate water out of clothes - has not changed in decades.
""We have seen breakthroughs like injecting bubbles into washing machines to wash the clothes more effectively,"" commented Jane Westgarth, a senior analyst at Mintel.
Another advantage of the ultrasonic technology is that it appears to generate far less lint.
Most of the lint created in conventional tumble dryers is the result of tiny fibres being dislodged from clothes by the hot air stream.
As well as causing extra wear on the fabric, the heat can fade clothes over time.

Hamilton wins fourth F1 world title
Only fifth man in history to do so
Lewis Hamilton has been crowned the 2017
world champion -- his fourth title -- despite finishing ninth in what proved to be an intriguing Mexico Grand Prix.
Eventual race winner Max Verstappen's aggressive start in Mexico saw him take the lead from Hamilton's chief title rival Sebastian Vettel on the outside of the first corner, though there was contact between the pair.
Hamilton then found a gap to squeeze ahead of Vettel but the pair collided, causing damage to the German's front wing and a puncture to the Briton's rear tire.
Both had to pit at the end of lap one, with Vettel undergoing a nose change and Hamilton a tire change.
2008, 2014, 2015 & now 2017
has joined an elite band of drivers
So in a bizarre turn of events, after four laps of the race, the two world championship title challengers were last and second last.
Vettel and Hamilton gradually moved up the field but the German had left himself too much to do to take his world title challenge to the season's penultimate race in Brazil.
Ahead of Sunday's race, most thought claiming the world championship in Mexico was little more than a formality for Hamilton given his points lead in the drivers' title race, but just to make matters interesting the Mercedes car had struggled for pace in the altitude compared to Vettel's Ferrari in qualifying.
Verstappen had initially broken the track record to take pole position, but a blistering run from Vettel meant he would start from the front of the grid.
It was Vettel's 50th pole of his career, joining Hamilton, Schumacher and Ayrton Senna as the only drivers to reach the half century mark.
In an interview before the race, Verstappen was asked about the start of the Singapore Grand Prix six weeks ago in which he and Vettel collided before the first corner -- putting a huge dent in the German's title hopes -- and whether the same could happen again in Mexico.

""We have learned from our mistakes,"" was Verstappen's reply.
Except in Sunday's frenetic start there was contact between the pair again, though it was nothing like the carnage in Singapore.
""Simply, simply lovely,"" Verstappen said, admiring his handiwork, while Hamilton asked his team about the collision with Vettel: ""Did he hit me deliberately?"" ""I don't know, Lewis,"" was the reply.
While Vettel gradually began to fight his way through a congested field, Hamilton remained in last place and appeared unable to get anyway near Carlos Sainz Jr.'s Renault.
""I can't get close to a car,"" an exasperated Hamilton said over the team radio on lap 24.
To make matters worse, Hamilton was quickly blue flagged and overtaken by race leader Verstappen and teammate Valtteri Bottas.
It was the first time the 32-year-old had been lapped since the 2013 Spanish Grand Prix where he finished 12th.
Four laps later, Hamilton eventually passed Sainz but was soon relaying information to his garage that he was concerned about his tires lasting the duration of the race.
Ricciardo: I'm recognized in US more than ever
Ricciardo: I'm recognized in US more than ever
After 35 laps, Vettel found himself in eighth place, still a huge 63 seconds behind the second place he needed to keep his title hopes alive.
Conveniently for Hamilton -- though bad news for Vettel -- it was his Mercedes teammate Bottas who occupied that position.
Vettel, however, had just set the race's fastest lap and climbed to seventh to give him a glimmer of hope.
With 20 laps remaining, he then passed home favorite Sergio Perez with a brave, intricate move on the inside -- though it didn't go down well with the partisan crowd.
Vettel continued to set fastest laps and make his way through the field, finding himself in fifth and 50 seconds behind Bottas with 16 laps to go.
The German had at least made things interesting but, at this stage, would need a miracle to secure at least second place.

To make matters worse for Vettel, Hamilton had found some speed and began working his way up through the pack, eventually entering the points positions in 10th.
Hamilton eventually crushed any remaining hope Vettel had by brilliantly overtaking Fernando Alonso to take ninth place, leaving the German needing to win the race keep the world championship alive.
It was game over, ensuring Hamilton becomes the first driver to win a world championship after being lapped since James Hunt in 1976.
The Brit had previously said he wanted to win the title in style by standing atop the podium in Mexico.
The race didn't go as he would have dreamt it but he surely won't mind.
Hamilton is the 2017 world champion, allowing him to join Vettel and Frenchman Alain Prost on four world titles.
Britain's most successful ever driver is now only behind Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio's on five and Michael Schumacher, the all-time record holder on seven.

"My online stalker: The feeling he could hurt me never went away
Callum Blake-O'Brien created more than 17 fake accounts to send abusive messages
Stalker Callum Blake-O'Brien created numerous fake social media accounts to send women what prosecutors described as ""unimaginably horrendous"" messages. One teenager left ""emotionally numb"" by his unrelenting abuse says he ""handpicked"" his victims to cause maximum distress.
""When I read it, I felt really sick. It was talking about rape and torture.
""I took a screenshot. It was extremely long and in extremely graphic detail.""
Gemma, not her real name, told the BBC how she got her first message from him one night in March 2017, when she was in her bedroom.
""I only read the first few lines; I couldn't read on and my parents read the rest of it.
""My mum said 'you should go to the police'. I was freaked out.""
Gemma, who was then 17, initially wondered if the message was ""some kind of joke"".
She tried to find out who had sent it, but the communication was from an anonymous account that had been deactivated.
""By the time I read it, he had already created another account and starting sending other disturbing messages.
""The messages included one telling me I should not be afraid of dark alleyways because he preferred the daylight.""
He was given a 10-year restraining order banning him from contacting any of his victims
They then started to include personal information about Gemma's family, including her father's work. One even mentioned her eye colour.
""I wrote back 'who is this?' and asked 'why are you doing this?'""
Blake-O'Brien, from Hereford, sent more abusive messages in response.
Within days, her family had reported the messages to West Mercia Police.
Though Gemma went to the police station armed with screenshots, she was disappointed by the officer's response.
You might also be interested in:
""He told me the man was not a direct threat to me and that there was no chance of finding him because a proxy server was involved.""
She says he suggested deleting her Facebook account, which she was reluctant to do as she used it for her part-time job.
""I felt I was being dismissed as a young girl who was being overdramatic.""
The student, from Hereford, said a second officer she saw took ""a few weeks"" to file a Child Exploitation and Online Protection report.
Reports are made by people or authorities worried about online abuse, or the way someone is communicating online, and should be filed immediately.
""The dismissal by the police made me feel even more isolated,"" says Gemma, now aged 18.
""I did deactivate my account a few times and kept blocking him but he created new accounts.
""In all, he sent me about 75 to 100 messages from five different accounts.
""I became emotionally numb to the messages but the feeling he could hurt me never went away.
""I felt like I couldn't go out and became anxious - and I've never been anxious before.""
Two of the messages sent to Gemma made her fear for her life
After a few weeks, the messages abruptly stopped. April and May passed without incident, but the reprieve was short-lived.
""I was on the phone to my friend when I got another message request in June. I knew exactly what it was and who it was from. I was devastated.
""It had given me a bit of false hope when it stopped between April and June and I thought he had finally got the message.""
Gemma reluctantly went back to the police but this time saw a female officer and a detective who she said ""took this seriously"".
""I think she understood his power and how I was feeling.""
The officers soon linked the case to a police report by another woman who had received similar messages.
Two weeks later Blake-O'Brien was arrested.
""When I found out he was arrested in Hereford I completely broke down. It was the thought he could have walked past me multiple times,"" Gemma recalls.
Blake-O'Brien was jailed for 30 months at Worcester Crown Court
Her shock was further compounded when officers told her the name of the suspect - it was someone who had known her brother.
""He had handpicked all of us; either he knew us or had come into contact with us.""
The Crown Prosecution Service said Blake-O'Brien targeted several women.
The 25-year-old knew some of the victims and was acquainted with others, it said.
At Worcester Crown Court, he admitted counts against 10 women and was
Seven offences were of stalking involving the fear of violence, while three involved sending an electronic communication of an indecent or grossly offensive nature.
Blake-O'Brien will spent 15 months on licence, and was also handed a 10-year restraining order banning him from contacting any of his victims.
He is further prohibited from using any device capable of accessing the internet unless it has the capacity to retain and display the history of online use.
Though relieved her stalker has been bought to justice, looking back, Gemma feels upset about how the case was handled.
She wants Facebook to introduce a helpdesk so people can easily report online abuse and believes the police, prosecution and defence counsel had a ""limited understanding"" of how social media worked.
""[That] shouldn't be the case as these crimes will increase in the future.
""I'm a teenage girl and I couldn't enjoy that whole year of my life.""
Det Insp Ross Jones, of West Mercia Police, urged anyone dissatisfied with how they were dealt with by officers to lodge a complaint with the force.
He also praised the victims for coming forward.
""Their bravery played a vital role in achieving this custodial sentence.
""Despite this, I know that victims of such crimes can experience long-lasting effects on their mental health and wellbeing.
""All of the people who reported Blake-O'Brien's offences to us have been offered specialist counselling to help them.
""West Mercia Police works hard to ensure all officers know how to deal with reports of offences like this, and will continue to do so.""

"BA probes crew member's anti-Nigerian Snapchat rant
British Airways has launched an investigation after a staff member posted an offensive rant on the social app Snapchat.
The flight attendant filmed herself before working on a flight to Nigeria. She mocked Nigerian accents and made lewd remarks about body parts.
A concerned member of staff who saw the video shared it with the Daily Mail.
BA said: ""We expect the utmost professionalism from our staff when they are representing British Airways.
""We will not tolerate offensive comments about our customers and will always take the appropriate action.""
In the video - captioned ""I can't cope with this flight"" - the woman can be heard putting on a fake Nigerian accent.
""All the Nigerians are gonna be there like 'gimme Coca Cola, gimme me beef, why you have no beef left? I want beef',"" she says.
Referring in explicit language to the size of Nigerian men's genitals, she then goes on to claim that all the Nigerian passengers will ask for upgrades.
She can also be heard complaining that she has to work on a Friday evening while others are drinking.
Many in Nigeria have used social media to react to the flight attendant's comments. Alao Abayomi said: ""Even if we like free stuff, that does not mean you rub our noses in it.
""The money they make in Nigeria alone, is enough for us to request more than upgrades. Please let her bosses upgrade her punishment to sack level.""

"'Celebrity Big Brother' season 1 finale: And the winner is ...

Omarosa talks Trump on 'Big Brother'
Omarosa talks Trump on 'Big Brother'
This story contains spoiler's about the finale of ""Celebrity Big Brother.""
The first celebrity edition of ""Big Brother"" crowned a winner Sunday night.
First, we should tell you it was not Omarosa Manigault.
The veteran reality TV star, who found fame alongside Donald Trump on ""The Apprentice,"" had famously served as director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison at the White House just prior to being cast on ""Big Brother.""
When her resignation from the White House was announced in December, there was a dispute over whether Manigault had been physically escorted off the White House grounds.
So her presence on the CBS reality series, in which a group of people are locked in a house and kept under constant surveillance for the viewing audience's pleasure, helped to elevate interest in the show as fans waited to see what tea she might spill about her time in Trump's administration.
But at the end of the show, actress Marissa Jaret Winokur was crowned the winner by a jury of her former housemates.
She won the $250,000 prize, defeating TV personality Ross Mathews, who took home $50,000 as the runner-up.
Mathews also won an additional $25,000 for being voted America's Favorite Houseguest.
Winokur had faced some criticism for selecting Mathews -- a tough competitor -- to be in the finale with her, but
that the pair had an alliance that she wanted to honor.
""I'm a 'Big Brother' fan and I know in 'Big Brother' Land, yes, that was the worst move,"" she said. ""But in my heart and in my soul -- and in being a mother -- [I wanted] to show [that] if you have a good friend, regardless of what the outcome is, you take your friend.""

"LL Cool J is first rapper to land Kennedy Center honour
LL Cool J is also the joint youngest receipient at the age of 49
LL Cool J will be the first hip-hop artist to receive a Kennedy Centre honour later this year.
He will be awarded alongside musician Lionel Richie, singer Gloria Estefan, TV writer Normal Lear and dancer Carmen de Lavallade.
The awards annually celebrate arts figures for their contributions to American culture.
""To be the first rap artist honoured by the @kencen is beyond anything I could have imagined.""
He added: ""Dreams don't have deadlines. God is great.""
At 49, he ties with Stevie Wonder as the youngest artist to receive the honour.
Set to take place on 3 December in the Kennedy Centre Opera House, this will be the first ceremony to take place under President Trump.
President Trump angered some with his proposal to scrap the National Endowment for the Arts, which provides arts funding in the US
As is the tradition, the President and First Lady will have dinner with the honourees and a White House reception followed by a range of performances in the Kennedy Center Opera House.
LL Cool J, less commonly known as James Todd Smith,
""I am blown away. This is the biggest musical award you can receive.
""To be recognised by your country, and to be able to represent hip-hop as an art form is amazing. I'm surprised, grateful, humbled and honoured.""
Lear, who created 1970s sitcoms including All in the Family,
he would not be attending the ceremony: ""This is a presidency that has chosen to neglect totally the arts and humanities - deliberately defund them - and that doesn't rest pleasantly with me.""
Stevie Wonder (right) received the honour in 1999
But LL Cool J said he wouldn't be put off.
""I don't have any stunts planned. I'm not saying I need to be there backslapping and all of that, but this time, this one ain't about him,"" he said, referring to President Trump.
He continued: ""I'm not going to block my blessings or let the political divide stop me from embracing my art. I'm banking on the goodness and the optimism of people to say: 'You know what? I get it. Let this guy have this honour.'""
LL Cool J is no stranger to accolades and awards having won two Grammys for best rap solo performance in 1992 and 1997 and four NAACP Image Awards for his role as special agent Sam Hanna in NCIS: Los Angeles.

"Countdown to Brexit: How to divide food sold to the EU
Here's a Brexit recipe: lamb with grapes and lemon.
I haven't tried it, but the
does exist and it looks delicious in the pictures I've seen. It also gives us the ingredients for looking at one of the food issues that comes up as the UK prepares to leave the European Union.
All of them are covered by a trade arrangement that most people have spent their lives blissfully unaware of.
It goes by the name of ""tariff rate quotas"".
Now what on Earth does that mean?
When countries import goods, including foods, they often impose a tariff, a tax that is applied only to traded goods.
The UK does not currently have its own national tariffs. They are set by the EU for all member nations.
Countries and blocs of countries such as the EU, that are members of the World Trade Organization, have made commitments to the others that the tariffs will not exceed certain levels.
Many countries have agreed to import a certain quantity of some goods at a lower or even zero tariff, as a negotiated compromise between the interests of:
domestic producers concerned about exposure to foreign competition
That quantity of goods that gets in on the lower tax rate is called a tariff rate quota.
It is a bread and butter dish on the trade negotiating menu, routine enough to have its own acronym, which is TRQ.
TRQs are often used for farm products.
The EU has about 100, negotiated at the WTO on behalf of all member states, which currently have an impact on the UK.
All three of our ingredients have a TRQ for imports into the EU.
In the case of lamb, 280,340 tonnes a year can be imported at a reduced tariff.
There's a quota for table grapes of 1,500 tonnes, and for lemons it's 10,000 tonnes.
So how does Brexit come into this picture?
The UK and the remainder of the EU have to work out how to divide the existing TRQs.
The EU doesn't want to take the existing TRQs for the 28 states and use them for the remaining 27, because each EU country may end up importing more food on the low tariffs, therefore creating tougher competition for EU farmers.
Unlike on many other Brexit issues the UK and the EU actually agreed, and told the other WTO members,
, that they wanted to divide the TRQs in line with recent trade flows.
That would mean, for example, the UK taking a large share of the quota for lamb because comparatively the UK has been importing more lamb than the other EU countries.
But the proposal was met with a raspberry by several countries, including the United States, Canada and New Zealand.
Although the UK-EU proposal would give the same total TRQs as today, they would lose flexibility.
As things stand, if the price of lamb fell in the UK, they could divert some or all of it to other parts of the EU. After Brexit, that would not be possible.
The other WTO countries feel they should be compensated with a higher combined TRQ in order to maintain the same commercial benefit they currently enjoy.
In other words, they see Brexit as an opportunity to negotiate better access for their goods to Europe.
In some cases, the UK could decide to remove the tariffs altogether.
Now, some economists think we should do that anyway with all tariffs, that Brexit is a glorious opportunity for unilateral free trade.
This seems politically unlikely for products where there are UK producers.
In our recipe, lamb is a case in point.
Unrestricted tariff free access for lamb from anywhere in the world would be a problem for many British lamb producers.
With lemons, that is not an issue. We are not citrus producers.
There are British table grapes. It's not a big industry, but it is a new one so that might need some consultation with producer and consumer groups too.
There's another complication: cross-Channel trade.
British farmers can now automatically sell, for example, their lamb to France tariff free.
The same applies to French cheese sold in the UK.
Depending on what sort of deal there is, that might not be true after Brexit.
So will the UK and the EU get some share of each other's TRQs? That's another thing to be negotiated.

"Marilyn Manson was in 'excruciating pain' after stage accident
Marilyn Manson: 'The pain was excruciating'
Marilyn Manson has discussed for the first time the ""excruciating"" stage accident that resulted in a leg injury and nine postponed tour dates.
The singer was crushed when a giant prop gun collapsed on him during a concert in New York on 30 September.
""It was terrifying,"" said the rock star, who needed a plate and 10 screws in his fibula after the accident.
that, contrary to media reports, he was not responsible for the prop toppling over.
""I wasn't trying to climb it,"" said the 48-year-old.
""It started to fall and I tried to push back and I didn't get out the way in time.
""I'm not sure what I hit my head on, but it did fall on to my leg and break the fibula in two places. The pain was excruciating.""
Eyewitness Anthony Biscardi recalls the moment a prop collapsed on US rockstar Manson
It took several minutes for the stage crew to free Manson, who appeared limp and unconscious.
As well as the injury to his lower leg, the star required a screw through his ankle bone. He has spent the last two weeks recovering at home in Los Angeles.
Manson said he regretted that his tour ""got cut off right"" just as he ""was about to put it into second gear"".
But he added, ""I'll be back there really shortly, and it's going to be as exciting as it was starting out.""
The star has rescheduled several US tour dates for January and February 2018. He is due to play seven UK dates in December.

"Jennifer Lawrence: I was placed in 'nude line-up'
Jennifer Lawrence speaking at Elle's Women in Hollywood event in Los Angeles
Jennifer Lawrence has said she was made to stand in a nude line-up and told to lose weight by film producers at the start of her career.
Speaking at Elle's Women in Hollywood event, the 27-year-old said she felt she didn't have any power in the situation as an unknown actress.
She said she found that fame protected her from assault as her career went on.
""I will lend my voice to any boy, girl, man or woman who doesn't feel like they can protect themselves"", she added.
The actress, who won an Oscar in 2013 for her role in Silver Linings Playbook, told the audience about auditioning for a film and being made to stand in a nude line-up.
She described the experience, which happened early on in her career, as ""degrading and humiliating"", as she was put next to girls she says were thinner than her.
Jennifer Lawrence speaking to Laura Dem at the Elle celebration
""When I was much younger and starting out, I was told by producers of a film to lose 15 pounds in two weeks.
""One girl before me had already been fired for not losing the weight fast enough,"" she told an audience including Kristen Stewart, Margot Robbie and Ashley Greene.
""During this time a female producer had me do a nude line-up with about five women who were much, much, thinner than me. We all stood side by side with only tape on covering our privates.""

Lawrence said the producer then told her she should ""use the naked photos"" of herself as ""inspiration"" for her diet.
She then went to complain to another producer about being called out over her weight.
""He said he didn't know why everyone thought I was so fat, he thought I was 'perfectly [attractive]',"" Lawrence told the crowd.
The actress said she felt ""trapped"" by the experience and allowed the harassment to happen because she ""didn't want to be a whistleblower"" and thought it was what she had to do to further her career in Hollywood.
She told the audience: ""In a dream world, everyone is treated with the exact same level of respect.

""Stop normalising these horrific situations""
Lawrence's speech comes after the sexual harassment and assault accusations against film producer Harvey Weinstein, which has lead to a growing narrative on the mistreatment of women in the film industry and Hollywood in particular.
Lawrence worked on with Weinstein on Silver Linings Playbook. She released a statement last week in response, which said: ""This kind of abuse is inexcusable and absolutely upsetting.
""I worked with Harvey five years ago and I did not experience any form of harassment personally, nor did I know about any of these allegations.""
Lawrence said in her speech it was time for people in Hollywood to ""stop normalising these horrific situations.""

He's the man hailed as a hero in Fiji -- the man whose face
; who possesses an honorary title and a three-acre plot of land. But today, Ben Ryan is trying to transform another nation's rugby fortunes.
After guiding the Pacific island nation to its
-- rugby sevens gold at Rio 2016 -- Ryan has returned to the touchline as a consultant coach with France.
A long-established heavyweight of the fifteen-a-side game, when it comes to sevens the French have some catching up to do. Since 1999, Les Bleus haven't finished above seventh in the World Series with just one tournament victory in that time.
""There's no tradition of seven-a-side in France, they almost have a blank page where they're trying to create a new culture of the game,"" Ryan tells CNN World Rugby at a recent training camp in Marrakech.
""Right now, they're knocking on the door of eighth, ninth in the world. They want to be a lot higher than that. They want to be consistent.""
An Englishman's island odyssey
Ben Ryan spent a golden three years with Fiji's sevens team.

Ryan moved to the Pacific Islands with his interest in the game at its lowest ebb after being disillusioned by his job with the English RFU.

Fiji won two successive men's Sevens World Series titles, and backed that up to take Olympic gold at Rio 2016.

But that was dwarfed by the celebrations that greeted both Ryan and his players on their return to Fiji after August's Games.

In the ensuing months, Ryan attended a number ceremonies for him and his players.
An Englishman's island odyssey
Members of the public would line up at his home in Fiji to give him gifts and thank him for what he had achieved.
After the Rio Olympics, Ryan suddenly found himself propelled into the public eye and inundated with demands for his time.
He met with investors about the possibility of turning his journey with Fiji into

But as far as rugby sevens goes, France has called upon the right man. Ryan boasts arguably the best CV in the game.
After coaching England for six years, he took Fiji to another level. On top of Olympic glory, the Pacific island nation won back-to-back World Series titles in 2015 and 2016. It's this pedigree that is motivating France's players.
""I suppose when the players see someone who has had success at world, Olympic and continental level telling them that they're good players and that they've done something well ... that's going to help them feel good about themselves,"" says Ryan.
""Perhaps I can give them a slightly different set of eyes on how the game could be played ... I've given a few tips for them, some encouragement.""

Toulon and Toulouse: The state of French rugby
As far as the players are concerned, even as Ryan watches from the side of a training ground, his aura inspires.
""He knows everything about the game of sevens,"" says Pierre-Gilles Lakafia, a relative veteran of the French side with 118 matches under his belt.
""Just the fact that he's here is a big thing for us. He's a superstar, everybody knows him, everybody recognizes what he does.""
Rediscovering France's 'élan'
Over the past 50 years, France has for long periods been the dominant force in the European 15-a-side game.
But having recently fallen upon testing times, Ryan believes it is through the free-flowing, razzle-dazzle of sevens that France could rediscover its former glory.
""The French [fifteen-a-side] team of the 1980s played with this élan, this French spirit -- that was really beautiful to watch,"" he says
""It's disappeared from French rugby in the last 20 years, probably with professionalism, and if it's going to return it's going to return through these guys.
""Every opportunity to play a game that's based on flare, and skill, and individual decisions -- that would be amazing if we can get them to play like that. That's something perhaps the whole of French rugby has moved away from.""
Playing with flare is one thing. But Ryan's coaching philosophy goes beyond side-stepping and ball-handling. How you treat players off the field, he says, is instrumental in dictating how they perform on it.

""If you get the best out the people you're working with then you're going to get good results,"" he explains.
""To make sure that everyone feels they can say what they want and that they have a purpose ... that I make them feel valued, that you treat people nicely.
""Certainly within Fiji -- the three years I had in Fiji -- showed you can be absolutely ruthless on the field and win world titles and Olympic gold medals but you can also be very nice to people.""
It's a school of thought Ryan is deeply invested in and one he also has inked on his forearm. ""Vei lomani"" is a Fijian phrase meaning ""love one another.""
He once said that he wouldn't know how he'd be able to coach a team against Fiji, and this could go some way to explaining why Ryan's time with the French side is limited to just a few days a year.
Currently eighth in the World Series standings, only time will tell whether the effects of Ryan's gold dust will be felt by Les Bleus.
But regular season aside, there's a World Cup in the USA on the horizon and any number of sides, says Ryan, could have their hands on silverware come July 22.
""There's every opportunity for a team that gets their tails up and a bit of wind behind their backs to come from the pack,"" he muses.
""I could quite easily see a team that perhaps isn't a favorite for the World Cup getting to the final stages.
""The French hope it's them.""

"Trump trade war: China vows retaliation if tariffs bite
Trump on new tariffs: 'We haven't been treated fairly'
China has warned that it does not want a trade war with the US, but will not sit idly by if its economy is hurt.
Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for China's National People's Congress, made the comments amid controversy over Donald Trump's announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.
The US president has also threatened to impose a tax on EU-made cars, and earlier said ""trade wars are good"".
US trading partners, the IMF and the WTO have strongly criticised his moves.
What does Trump want to do and why?
Mr Trump has decried the ""$800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our 'very stupid' trade deals and policies"", and vowed to end it.
On Thursday, he said steel imports would face a 25% tariff and aluminium 10%.
Then came Saturday's threat on EU-made cars.
The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our “very stupid” trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)
End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump
In January, he had already announced tariffs on solar panels and washing machines.
What are US trading partners making of this?
China's Zhang Yesui said it was natural that ""some friction will exist"" between the US and China, given the volume of trade between them surpassed $580bn (£420bn) last year.
But he said China would take ""necessary measures"" if its interests were hurt.
Canada said tariffs would cause disruption on both sides of the border. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was ""confident we're going to continue to be able to defend Canadian industry"".
on around $3.5bn of imports from the US - targeting iconic US exports including Levi's jeans, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and Bourbon whisky.
Brazil, Mexico and Japan, that have said they will consider retaliatory steps if the president presses ahead with his plan next week.
Has Trump got political support for a trade war?
A number of Republicans have questioned the wisdom of the tariff proposal and have been urging the president to reconsider.
Senator Orrin Hatch said American citizens would be made to pay.
Critics say the plan could put US jobs at risk
Senator Ben Sasse agreed that ""kooky 18th Century protectionism will jack up prices on American families"".
Industry bodies like the US Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association have expressed deep concern.
But steelworkers in Pennsylvania and Indiana will welcome Mr Trump's comments.
Is Trump right about the trade imbalance?
The US imports steel from more than 100 nations and brings in four times more steel from abroad than it exports.
Since 2000, the US steel industry has suffered, with production dropping and the number of employees in steel work falling.
The US is the largest export market for EU cars - making up 25% of the €192bn (£171bn; $237bn) worth of motor vehicles the bloc exported in 2016 (China was second with 16%).

Dressen, who was the 19th racer to go on a clear day after the storms of earlier in the week, clocked a time of one minute 56.15 seconds to edge out leader Swiss Beat Feuz, winner of last week's downhill in Wengen, by .20 seconds.

The former F1 supremo interrupts
's chat with man of the moment Thomas Dressen.
The excited German pumped his arms and then skis in the air before sinking to his haunches and shaking his head at what he had just achieved.
""It's just an unbelievable feeling because it was really a surprise to me that I was in the lead as I crossed the finish line and I had to look at the timing board twice to believe it,"" Dressen told reporters afterwards.
""But then when I recognized that it was a really good one today I was just overwhelmed and rally happy about it.""
Dressen made his debut on the World Cup circuit in 2015 and claimed his first podium -- a third -- in the Beaver Creek downhill in December.
He became the first skier to win his debut World Cup race at Kitzbhuel since Didier Cuche in 1998. The Swiss went on to win the iconic Hahnenkamm downhill a record five times.
He is also the first German to win the Kitzbuhel downhill since Sepp Ferstl (representing West Germany) in 1978 and 1979.
Austrian Hannes Reichelt, the 2014 winner, gave the raucous home fans something to cheer about with third place in 1:56.56.

The 35-year-old, one of the most successful racers in skiing speed disciplines over the last decade, was racing at Kitzbuhel for the first time since a season-ending crash on the Hahnenkamm in 2016.
Svindal, who has won two downhills so far this season and was second behind Feuz in Wengen, won the super-G from friend and countryman Kjetil Jansrud with Olympic downhill champion Matthias Mayer third and Reichelt fourth.
Frenchman Johan Clarey, who holds the record for the fastest speed registered in a World Cup race with 100.6 mph on the Lauberhorn in Wengen in 2013, suffered the downhill's most notable crash Saturday but was able to walk away unscathed.
The men's speed circuit heads to Germany for next week's race in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.
Norway's Henrik Kristoffersen finally got the better of World Cup leader Marcel Hirscher with victory over the Austrian in the Kitzbuhel slalom Sunday.
Kristoffersen has had to settle for six podium spots in slalom this season, while six-time overall World Cup champion Hirscher has bagged five wins, plus three in giant slalom.
But over two runs on a snowy Ganslernhang course, the 23-year-old Kristoffersen turned the tables to clinch his 16th World Cup victory and first since January 2017.
Kristoffersen won bronze in the slalom at the Sochi Winter Games in 2014 to become the youngest male medalist in Olympic alpine skiing.
Hirscher took silver four years ago behind countryman Mario Matt, who became the oldest champion in Olympic skiing at 34 and has since retired, although his brother Michael, 24, is making a name for himself with three podiums this season.

"How Sting, Springsteen and Billy Joel healed America
By Maro Chermayeff, Special to CNN
Updated 0534 GMT (1334 HKT) April 28, 2017
How music helped us heal after 9/11
How music helped us heal after 9/11
Whenever I think about a pivotal event in my personal life, there always seems to be a song associated with it:
Driving cross-country alone at dawn?
Holding my baby for the first time?
But then there are the songs that have not only defined
personal history, but yours as well.
The songs that became so associated with moments in time and so helped define history that they turned into anthems, because they speak universal truths to all of us.
This is what I witnessed happening in the wake of the
I was born and raised in New York, and the impact and scars left by this tragic event both traumatized and galvanized the city and our world. Some, like myself, wanted to go out in the world and try to make things different. I had for several years considered adopting a baby, and it was after 9/11 that I felt an instinctual response to take action and do the things I had always wanted to do without letting fear and hesitation rule my destiny.
For others, the shock and horror of the attacks left them wanting to crawl in a hole and pull the hole in after them. For those who survived or lost their loved ones, the pain has never gone away.
How music helped us heal after 9/11
How music helped us heal after 9/11
Through it all, music was the leveling force, playing a role in the necessary healing that began to take place almost instantaneously after that shocking day. While certain songs came to mean different things to different people, the ability for music to bring comfort and calm, and to pull people together, was an inevitability.
The power of music is what inspired the
which I produce along with Jeff Dupre, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Dany Garcia. We all felt that the events of September 11 and the music surrounding it should be included in the series, but we also all felt that the 9/11 episode was one of the hardest to put together.
We knew where we would begin -- on that fateful morning -- but where would we end? The impact of that day is still deeply felt in communities across the US and across the world.
In the end, we realized we were all struck by two classic songs from two amazing and iconic artists: Sting's ""Fragile"" and Bruce Springsteen's ""The Rising.""
""Fragile"" was a song that Sting had already written and performed.
, the song took on new meaning and emotional impact.
The lyrics included a line that seemed almost tailor-made for that moment, offering an amazing example of how a preexisting song can meet a current moment and be given new depth. ""If blood will flow, when flesh and steel are one, drying the color of the evening sun,"" Sting sang, ""tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away, but something in our minds will always stay.""
Springsteen's ""The Rising,"" on the other hand, is an album and a song written in direct response to and specifically about 9/11. The song is beautiful, and the fact that an artist of Springsteen's stature dedicated an entire album to this tragedy spoke volumes, and was deeply appreciated by everyone who felt they needed to find connection through music to get through the pain.
When talking about the 9/11 episode, my production team and I also knew we wanted to interview Billy Joel and Paul Simon to discuss ""New York State of Mind, and ""The Sound of Silence."" Both of these songs were written many years before the September 11 attacks, but they both spoke to a mood and a tone that the city desperately needed.
""Sound of Silence"" became a particularly moving song because so many survivors and first responders referenced that when the towers fell, New York was in some ways quieter then it had ever been.
Billy Joel on his 'love song' to NYC
Billy Joel on his 'love song' to NYC
The sirens, the cars, the people were all quiet -- and just trying to find their way through. I believe this song helped people to focus in their pain at the time as well as many years later, when Paul Simon played it to mark the 10th anniversary. Like ""New York State of Mind,"" it was a universal song, and a very well known song that helped people join together to find a way forward.

Toby Keith on the message of his music
Of course, you can't discuss the September 11 attacks without discussing the repercussions the event triggered both socially and politically. In the wake of that tragedy, the doors then opened to very different kinds of music -- including songs of patriotism, anger and unrest, from Toby Keith's ""Courtesy of the Red White and Blue (The Angry American)"" to the Dixie Chicks' amazing and personal song ""Not Ready to Make Nice.""
These are songs that speak to our emotions, bringing history alive not with facts and figures but with feelings. The ability to speak to events, issues and ideas through a collective experience is something that music is able to do like no other art form.

"Behind the lens with an award-winning sports photographer
Updated 1002 GMT (1802 HKT) May 30, 2017
Clive Mason fell in love with sailing photography in the early 1980s, covering events while sleeping in his camper van.
A veteran of the last four Olympic regattas, the award-winning photographer has followed boats around the world, from the Acropolis of Athens 2004 to the ""quintessentially British"" setting of London 2012.
comprises hundreds of Formula One races, numerous football, rugby and cricket World Cups, as well as coverage of the English Premier League.
And among Mason's many awards, the Getty Images photographer was recently awarded the prize for the
at the British Sports Journalists' Association awards, in recognition of his work at Rio 2016.
Take a look at the 10 photos that impressed the judges and find out about the challenges of documenting elite sport below...
Andreas Cariolou, RS-X (Cyprus)
The sun was beginning to set over the Marina da Glória and Mason was finishing up for the day. All he needed was that one perfect shot and, ""as if by magic,"" Cypriot windsurfer Andreas Cariolou glided directly past the press boat as he made his way to shore.
Ben Saxton & Nicola Groves, Nacra 17 (Great Britain)
Sailors are not averse to ""playing up"" for the cameras, jokes Mason, telling CNN the more brazen showboaters will deliberately seek to sail past the working press.
Nathan Outteridge, 49er skiff (Australia)
But the photographer's craft is also about intensely ""personal"" moments. Mason says he was ""lucky"" to get the opportunity to shoot Australian sailor Nathan Outteridge washing down his boat in this pragmatic, four or five days before the hustle and bustle of Olympic competition.
""I love this picture,"" Mason says, telling CNN he and his fellow professionals sometimes find themselves forming bonds with the athletes they cover over the years, quietly sharing their moments of victory.
Ben Saxton & Nicola Groves, Nacra 17 (Great Britain)
As the events started and windsurfers, dinghies and skiffs flew by in the shadow of Sugarloaf Mountain, Mason freely admits Rio 2016 became as much about the topography as the sailing talent.
Pablo Abella & Mariana Costa, Nacra 17 (Uruguay)
t times, the photographers had to remind themselves what they were actually there to shoot. After all, ""not every picture could look like a chocolate box.""
Finn Class in the shadow of Sugarloaf Mountain
This image, taken ""late in the afternoon"" on the Copacabana, depicts the ""abstract"" sails of the Finn fleet positioned directly below Christ the Redeemer. It's a photo that could adorn the wall of any home; indeed, Mason confirms he's had numerous requests for prints.
Giles Scott, Finn class (Great Britain)
But there was a whole lot more to Rio 2016 than stunning scenery. In this image, Mason captures the exact moment Giles Scott realizes he has sealed the gold medal for Great Britain. It's the final product of careful planning on the part of the photographer -- Scott's lead was already unassailable the day before the medal race.
Ben Saxton and Nicola Groves, Nacra 17 (Great Britain)
Mason describes the image of Scott's elation as ""one the nicest, cleanest"" he's ever taken -- explaining the ultimate aim is always ""a picture that tells a story with a key moment, key athlete and beautiful light.""
But sometimes it's about pure action. Here, a member of the Nacra 17 Olympic fleet fights with testing winds on the Rio waters.
Mathew Belcher & Will Ryan, 470 class (Australia)
The photographer was ""in the lap of the Gods"" for this shot as he hung from side of a boat and utilized an underwater housing. Finely framed, ""the crest of the water leads into the shape of the sail.""
Mariana Costa & Pablo Abella, Nacra 17 (Uruguay)
""The day you stop thinking creatively, you become a machine,"" Mason concludes, admitting it's ""a huge sacrifice"" spending so much time away from family.
The pressure can be intense, burdened with the knowledge there are hoards of aspiring professionals ""biting at the ankles"" just waiting to take your place.
Interested in professional sports photography?
But after covering everything from the early stages of an Olympic sailing regatta to the FIFA World Cup final, this photographer has no intention of quitting.

"Sony's Clean Version: The story so far on film sanitisation
""Hmm - is this film suitable for me?""
If you've been on a long-haul flight recently, you might have noticed the films being shown were a bit different from their cinematic release.
They're usually a bit shorter as they've been made family-friendly for any young eyes who can see your screen.
Earlier this month Sony decided to make these sanitised versions available to download at home, choosing 24 titles including Ghostbusters and Easy A.
But now they've had to backtrack after filmmakers complained about the move.
After the outcry Man Jit Singh, president of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, said their directors were of ""paramount importance to us"" and they wanted to ""respect those relationships to the utmost"".
""We believed we had obtained approvals from the film-makers involved, for use of their previously supervised television versions as a value-added extra on sales of the full version,"" he said.
""But if any of them are unhappy or have reconsidered, we will discontinue it for their films.""
The Clean Version initiative was launched, complete with its own website, at the beginning of June. So what's the story so far?
Emma Stone's Easy A is one of the films to be on Sony's initial Clean Version list
How did Sony announce the scheme?
In its initial press release, Sony said the initiative would ""allow viewers to screen the broadcast or airline versions of select Sony films, free from certain mature content"".
""allows viewing for a wider audience giving people the chance to watch their favourite films together"".
The move comes after third party services had been making similar edits of films - so Sony decided to do the work themselves too.
How do people get a clean version?
They can choose to download a clean version of the film from a number of platforms listed on Sony's website.
The original version is included together with the edited film.
Seth Rogen (left) and Judd Apatow have spoken out against the scheme and want to keep their films as they are
What has the reaction been?
Knocked Up star Seth Rogen (who doesn't have any films affected by the move so far) was one of the first to react when news of Clean Version emerged. He pleaded, adding a swear word for emphasis, ""please don't do this to our movies"".
He went on to explain some of the changes that were made to a TV version of Pineapple Express, by way of an example - saying that one expletive became ""j'accuse!"" and the word ""casserole"" was used to substitute a similar-sounding swear word.
Here's an exchange he had on Twitter about the Sony scheme:
Judd Apatow, who produced Step Brothers - one of the first films to have a Clean Version released -
: ""So now we are being asked if we are okay with our movies being released in a sanitised form. Let me be clear - it is not okay.""
: ""This is good news for consumers. Parents get to introduce the kids to some of their favourite films and those without little ones can go ahead and watch them the way they were meant to be seen.""
The Directors Guild of America (DGA) has said the ""hard-fought-for rights that protect a director's work and vision"" are ""at the very heart of our craft and a thriving film industry"".
They said: ""The DGA has notified Sony that it expects the immediate removal of all 'clean' versions of the affected films from availability until Sony secures permission from each and every director, and provides them with an opportunity to edit a version for release in new media.""
Which films are included?
There's an initial list of 24 films which have been watered down. They include action dramas, superhero movies and romcoms.
Those films are: 50 First Dates, Battle Of The Year, Big Daddy, Captain Phillips, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Easy A, Elysium, Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters II, Goosebumps, Grown Ups, Grown Ups 2, Hancock, Inferno, Moneyball, Pixels, Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3, The Amazing Spider-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Step Brothers, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, and White House Down.
Step Brothers, starring Will Ferrell, had 152 swears taken out
How have they been changed?
It varies from film to film - perhaps unsurprising as their ratings vary from PG to R.
For example, the clean version of Will Ferrell comedy Step Brothers - originally given an R rating for ""crude and sexual content"" according to Sony - has had 23 instances of violence taken out, 152 of bad language and 91 of sexual content.
The Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler romcom 50 First Dates had a PG13 for ""crude sexual humour and drug references"". Its clean version has 10 violent moments taken out, 34 uses of bad language and 34 instances of sexual content.
And Matt Damon sci-fi film Elysium, which also had an R rating for ""bloody violence"", had 18 of those violent moments taken out, 63 uses of bad language and one instance of sexual content.
Horror comedy Goosebumps was a PG when it came out - so could be described as family-friendly already. But its clean version had four fewer incidences of violence, with five uses of bad language and five examples of nudity taken out too.
Here's how Sony say they've been changed:
We wait and see if any of the films are removed from Sony's list - and if they end up adding more to it, or scrapping the scheme altogether.
It will be also interesting to see what the public reaction is to the scheme, as it's not entirely clear who it is aimed at, with many of the films already considered to be suitable for older children - and others perhaps not appealing to a younger audience at all in the first place.
But at least film fans can rest assured that they can still watch versions filled with profanity, violence and nudity if they so desire.

"Plastic waste 'building up' in Arctic
Plastic waste has been found everywhere that researchers have looked for it
Plastic waste is building up in the supposedly pristine wilderness of the Norwegian Arctic, scientists say.
Researchers are particularly concerned about huge concentrations of microplastic fragments in sea ice.
They say they've found plastic litter almost everywhere in the Arctic they have looked.
Norwegian fishermen are worried that their fish stocks may lose their reputation for being untouched by pollution.
Most of the large plastic waste there comes from discarded fishing gear.
And boat owners admit it will take hundreds of years to overcome a few reckless decades of using the sea as a dump.
Plastic pollution is killing animals in the Arctic
Norway's environment minister says politicians in the past haven't fully registered the extent of the problem.
A synthesis report from the Norwegian Polar Institute to the recent Arctic Frontiers conference in Tromsø says there's a great need for more research into the extent of possible harm from plastic.
It says effects have been monitored so far on zooplankton, invertebrates, fish, seabirds, and mammals.
Research shows that up to 234 particles have been found concentrated into just one litre of melted Arctic sea ice. That's much higher than in the open ocean.
Researchers explain that sea ice forms from the top. By unfortunate coincidence, plastic particles also float at the surface, so they get bonded into the ice as it freezes.
Some of the fragments are very small
They are not yet sure how much of a threat this presents.
But they are worried about the impact on Arctic wildlife if the particles are released as sea ice continues to shrink.
Geir Wing Gabrielsen, one of the paper's authors, told BBC News: ""We are finding more and more plastic waste in Svalbard, where I work. ""The northern fulmar breeds in Svalbard.
""At the end of the 1970s we found very few plastic in their stomachs. In 2013 when we last investigated, some had more than 200 pieces of plastic in their stomachs.
""Other creatures are getting entangled in nets washed up on beaches - like reindeer. Some die because they can't release their antlers - we find them every year.""
He said in southern Norway pollution was dominated by plastics from the home - but in Svalbard 80% of it comes from fishing activities, local and distant.
Surveys suggest that fishing crews are increasingly aware of their responsibilities now.
Jan Roger Lerbukt, manager of Hermes Fishing in Tromsø told me: ""In the past 20 years I've seen a change in awareness in everyone towards protecting the environment.
""Fishing has been in our soul for thousands of years. If there's any environmental threat to the fish it's also a threat to our livelihood and that's a big concern.
""We have a reputation for a pure product and we don't want that damaged.""
He agreed that trawler crews used to throw tangled nets overboard, but says they now they return them to harbour.
He says they also salvage plastic litter they catch, under a scheme called Fishing for Litter.
Scientists are worried about the impact all this waste is having on wildlife
More and more crews are using paper packaging and moving away from plastic tape, he said.
But on a short walk along a plastic-strewn beach in Skulsfjord near Tromsø, I found clear evidence of fishing ropes still being deliberately cut.
And in the open water, ""ghost nets"" are easy to find.
Bo Eide, an environment consultant for Tromsø Council, conducts litter-picking on the beaches.
""People see the pictures in brochures of the pristine Arctic and they book their holidays to come here,"" he tells me.
""They're sometimes rather shocked to find that the Arctic in close-up is no longer how it looks in the brochures.""
Norway's environment Minister Ola Elvestuen told BBC News: ""It's disturbing - there's nowhere on Earth that's so far away that its not affected by plastics.
""This should be a call for action. It's been known about for years, but the magnitude of it hasn't been taken in as it should have been. We must stop the plastic pollution.""
Researchers say there's been no systematic microplastics survey of all parts of the Arctic. They hope to compile an inventory, potentially with the help of ""citizen scientists"".

"Carney calls for crackdown on cryptocurrency 'mania'
Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin should be regulated to crack down on illegal activities and protect the financial system, Mark Carney has warned.
The Bank of England governor said their inherent risks meant investing in cryptos could lose money.
""The time has come to hold the crypto-asset ecosystem to the same standards as the rest of the financial system,"" Mr Carney said in a speech on Friday.
Cryptocurrencies ""do not appear to pose material risks to financial stability"".
But he said that could change if more people began investing in them.
Although some countries have banned them, Mr Carney said regulation would be a better approach.
""A better path would be to regulate elements of the crypto-asset ecosystem to combat illicit activities, promote market integrity, and protect the safety and soundness of the financial system,"" he said.
Analysis: Simon Jack, BBC business editor
If the world of crypto-currencies like Bitcoin are the Wild West, a new sheriff just swaggered into town.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney laid down the law today with a withering assessment of Bitcoin's qualifications to be described as money and a warning that if allowed to grow unchecked, it could threaten financial stability.
Sheriff Carney said it fails as money because it is wildly volatile, poorly understood, inefficient and not widely accepted.
Digital currencies threaten stability because people may invest substantial amounts - mistakenly believing they are regulated - causing further loss of faith in the financial system if they collapse.
The evangelists of crypto-currencies will dismiss Mr Carney's assessment as the predictable response of a financial establishment that Bitcoin threatens.
If Governor Carney has his way, they will be saying: I fought the law and the law won.

"'Battlestar Galactica' cast reunites for out-of-this-world walk down memory lane
Updated 1636 GMT (0036 HKT) June 11, 2017
AUSTIN, TX - JUNE 10: (L-R) Michael Trucco, Katee Sackhoff, Edward James Olmos, James Callis, Mary McDonnell, Ronald D. Moore, Grace Park, and Tricia Helfer attend the closing night reunion panel of Battlestar Galactica during the ATX Television Festival on June 10, 2017 in Austin, Texas. (Photo by Rick Kern/Getty Images for Entertainment Weekly)
The ""Battlestar Galactica"" reunion at the ATX TV Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday didn't go entirely as planned.
""Technology is s—t,"" said one of the show's stars, Edward James Olmos, when cast member Jamie Bamber attempted to join the festivities via Skype but struggled with tech and sound problems.
Perhaps it's not a stretch to imagine what fans of the science fiction show in the audience at the Paramount Theater might have been thinking: ""So say we all.""
Still, the close-knit cast made the most of the otherwise special moment, and rose from their seats to send their love to Bamber via a webcam set up at the side of the stage.
Olmos was joined on stage at the Paramount Theater by executive producer Ron D. Moore and his other cast members: Katee Sackhoff, James Callis, Tricia Helfer, Grace Park, Mary McDonnell and Michael Trucco.

— Sandra Gonzalez (@TheSandraG)
The 90-minute reunion was largely a walk down memory lane. Actors shared casting tales, favorite moments and stories about trips to the now-defunct rental store Blockbuster to pick up the original 1978 television series.
But the event was also a tribute to the show's legacy as a groundbreaking science fiction program.
""I fell in love with all the characters,"" said McDonnell, who played President Laura Roslin on the show. ""That was really important to me. I attached to these people in the first read-through.""
""Battlestar Galactica"" ran from 2004 to 2009 on the Sci Fi channel, later rebranded as Syfy. Many of the actors involved will likely be best known for the roles they played on the show.
""This is the best usage of television I've ever been a part of in my life -- and I've been a part of some good ones,"" said Olmos, who played Commander William Adama. ""I don't think I'll ever do another show like this again in my lifetime. I was lucky I got one, ever.""
The ""Battlestar Galactica"" reunion was the main event at the ATX TV Festival, which ends Sunday.

""We are living in a time when the powers that be are trying to create as much difference between us as their pocket books will allow. And so with 'Battlestar,' we have a reminder that it can go away like that,"" McDonnell said. ""So perhaps we can stop dividing each other and stop seeing each other as the other, because there's no difference. And that's one of the things I loved the most about [the show].""

"Fishing 'best argument for seagrass conservation'
An indigenous child fisher in Indonesia collecting urchins and porcupine fish in seagrass
The importance of seagrasses is further emphasised in a new report that looks at how they underpin fishing worldwide.
These flowering plants, which grow in near-shore waters, are under intense pressure - some estimates suggest global losses are running at 7% a year.
The grasses provide shelter and food for many sea creatures and that makes them a natural draw to fishers.
But Richard Unsworth and colleagues say this valuable resource will need better management if it is to be sustained.
is really the first to show just how important seagrass meadows are to fishing,"" explained the researcher from Swansea University in the UK.
""Wherever you get seagrasses, you get fishing, basically,"" he told BBC News.
Seagrass meadows are found around every continent except Antarctica.
The plants cycle nutrients, stabilise sediments, and - as photosynthesisers - act as a ""sink"" for carbon dioxide.
They also provide nursery habitat for juvenile fish, which hide from predators among the stems.
However, the scale of the importance of the meadows to fisheries has been more supposition than fact because of a paucity of data on how they are actually used, according to Dr Unsworth.
The study details the many different types of gear used to fish among the plants
His team set about correcting this by interviewing experts - including other scientists and fisheries managers - on what they were observing around the world.
The team also took in case studies covering all regions from the Philippines to Zanzibar, Indonesia, the Turks and Caicos Islands and locations in the Mediterranean.
The picture that emerges is much the same everywhere.
Fishers actively target seagrasses because they recognise the habitats' great productivity.
This is true from small-scale recreational activity all the way through to large-scale commercial practice.
Fixed fyke nets are commonly placed in many seagrass meadows in Eastern Indonesia
The study details the types of tools and equipment used - from spears to nets - and the variety of species taken, from invertebrates such as crabs, shrimp and clams, to popular finfish such as mullet, herring and snapper.
One critical point to emphasise from the assessment is that many hundreds of millions of people worldwide depend on the catch from seagrass meadows for their daily protein intake.
This makes their conservation and proper management all the more important, says the team.
There is a claim that a meadow area equivalent to two football pitches is disappearing every hour.
Such statements are very hard to verify, but there is no doubt that seagrasses are being diminished by poor water quality in coastal areas as a result of agricultural and urban run-off, among several threats that also include insensitive fishing practices.
Team member Lina Nordlund, from Stockholm University, said: ""The ecological value of seagrass meadows is irrefutable, yet their loss continues at an accelerating rate.
""Now there is growing evidence globally that many fisheries associated to seagrass are unrecorded, unreported and unmanaged, leading to a tragedy of the seagrass commons.""
Netting for shrimp among seagrasses in north Wales
Dr Unsworth added: ""Arguments in support of seagrass have in the past too often focused on the fluffy - such as the conservation of seahorses.
""I don't want to dismiss seahorses' importance, but the reality is that seagrasses have much higher value in supporting fisheries. And I've come across numerous occasions where fishermen have been against conservation of seagrasses because they can't moor their boats in these locations, when it's those seagrasses that support their activity in the first place.
""What we need to do is increase the level of understanding and appreciation of these habitats.""
- is published in the journal Fish and Fisheries. Cardiff University was also involved in the research.

"Tencent chief 'richer than Google founders'
Tencent chief executive Ma Huateng is now worth more than Google's founders
The value of China's biggest social network company - Tencent Holdings - has overtaken that of Facebook.
The company owns WeChat, an enormously popular messaging app in China, and hit gaming franchises such as League of Legends and Honour of Kings.
It is the first Asian firm to surpass a market value of $500bn (£377bn).
Its chief executive, Ma Huateng, is now worth more than the founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, according to
The magazine valued him at $48.3bn on Tuesday, making him the world's ninth richest man according to its ranking.
Tencent's share price was lifted by the announcement that it would roll out its WeChat payment services in Malaysia next year.
The company also has a stake in Snap, the company behind Snapchat, ride-sharing app Lyft and electric-vehicle maker Tesla.
It is also expected to bring its hugely popular multiplayer game Honour of Kings to the United States.
The game - sometimes translated as King of Glory - lets players pay to upgrade their characters or costumes. Critics in China
Analysis by Robin Brant, political correspondent, Shanghai
Tencent now sits alongside a handful of US companies you are much more likely to have heard of: Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.
Its golden egg is called wei shin, known in English as WeChat. The app is almost ubiquitous in China - nearly a billion people use it every month.
What started out as a messaging platform now lets you pay for shopping, order a taxi, invest, get a takeaway… the list goes on.
WeChat dominates in China
Tencent is hoping to export this Chinese phenomenon abroad, and Malaysia is first in line for the payment system.
But it is proving difficult to get people outside China to embrace WeChat.
The company has long agreed to censor content in China - and abroad - in line with the demands of the Chinese government.
There are also persistent concerns about security because, unlike those on some other messaging apps, communications on WeChat are not encrypted.

"European Union grows at fastest pace for 10 years
The European Union economy grew at its fastest pace in a decade last year, figures from the EU statistics office Eurostat have confirmed.
The 28-strong EU expanded by 2.5% in 2017, its strongest performance since 2007 when it grew by 2.7%.
In the final three months both the EU and the 19-nation eurozone grew by 0.6% compared with the previous quarter.
That was mirrored by growth in the EU's biggest economy, Germany which grew by 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017.
France also expanded by 0.6% and Spanish growth was a notch stronger at 0.7%.
Overall in 2017, the eurozone grew by 2.5%, Eurostat said, the fastest growth rate since a 3% rise in 2007.

"Ariana Grande 'proud and grateful' as tour resumes
Grande uploaded a photo of herself performing in Paris
Ariana Grande has resumed her tour, just over two weeks after the terrorist attack at her Manchester Arena concert.
Twenty-two people were killed and 116 injured in a
""First show back tonight. Thinking of our angels every step of the way. I love you with all my heart,"" the singer wrote
""Grateful for and incredibly proud of my band, dancers and entire crew. I love you I love you.""
After the show, she posted: ""Merci, Paris ♡ Je t'aime.""
Security was tight at the show, with some fans
of themselves being searched as they went in.
French police had announced prior to the gig that security would be heightened because of the show's ""powerful symbolic context"".
Roads surrounding the venue were blocked off to traffic hours before the event started. Security staff searched all bags and police with sniffer dogs patrolled the venue.
Wednesday evening's show at the AccorHotels Arena in Paris marked her first full-length solo show since the attack and the resumption of her tour.
But her first live performance was on Sunday, when she
at One Love Manchester, a benefit concert to raise money for the victims of the suicide bombing and their families.
Grande collaborated with the Black Eyed Peas at the benefit gig
her Dangerous Woman tour after the Manchester attack - cancelling dates that had been scheduled in London, Poland, Germany and Switzerland.
Resuming her tour on Wednesday, the singer rattled through hits including Side To Side, Bang Bang, Into You and Problem.
She also added Somewhere Over the Rainbow to her usual set list - a song she performed at the end of the benefit concert in Manchester in honour of the victims.
How Ariana stood up against hate
Ariana wore a One Love Manchester sweater while she performed
On the morning of 23 May, BBC Radio 4's Today programme was filled with wall-to-wall coverage of the Manchester attack as accounts of what had happened the night before streamed in.
Early in the programme, the presenters confessed they hadn't previously heard of Ariana Grande - perhaps unsurprising given the lack of overlap between her target audience and Today's.
But less than two weeks later, a peak of 14.5 million people in the UK alone were tuning in to watch her close One Love Manchester with live renditions of One Last Time and Somewhere Over the Rainbow.
It was the highest TV audience of the year so far and broke iPlayer records for the most watched live non-sporting event ever.
As the concert drew to a close, it was hard to find anyone who wasn't praising Ariana for how she had handled the aftermath of the atrocity.
Ariana visited fans including 14-year-old Evie Mills in hospital after the attack
The singer visited fans in hospital. She organised the concert (admittedly with a great deal of help) and released a single to benefit the victims. All in all, she helped raise more than £10m for the Red Cross's Manchester Emergency Fund.
It's easy to assume young pop stars are bubble-wrapped and have all their decisions made for them. Which many are and do.
But few could dispute the grace with which Ariana took control and handled the aftermath of such a horrible event.
Nobody would have blamed her had she needed to take some time out after experiencing something so traumatic.
Having to process the grief of a terrorist attack happening on one of your tour dates is something many wouldn't even be able to begin to get their heads around.
Twenty-two people were killed in the attack at Manchester Arena
But, as her manager Scooter Braun said at the benefit gig, Ariana recognised the importance of carrying on in an act of defiance and unity.
""Hatred will never win, fear will never divide us, because on this day we all stood with Manchester,"" he said.
Grande was praised from all quarters after One Love Manchester.
her a ""legend"" while Pixie Lott
Even Piers Morgan, who had previously criticised her for flying back to the US immediately after the attack, was
Ariana herself told of how she'd met with the mother of Olivia Campbell-Hardy, one of the victims, who told her to stop crying because her daughter wouldn't have wanted it.
Instead, she encouraged Ariana to get up on stage and simply play the hits. And that's precisely what she did.
The singer now has a certain bond with the city of Manchester, and the affection she expressed to the city at the concert
Flowers left in memory of those killed
Ariana has live dates scheduled in Portugal, Spain and Italy later this month, before she moves on to the South American leg of her tour.
It's likely that no matter wherever she goes now, geographically or professionally, she'll be greeted with a new-found respect for how she dealt with such an unspeakable tragedy.

"300,000 people lose jobs each year due to poor mental health
300,000 people with long-term mental health problems lose their jobs each year, a report has found.
It also found poor mental health costs the UK economy up to £99bn each year.
Prime Minister Theresa May, who commissioned the report, said it shows ""we need to take action"". She is asking NHS England and the civil service to accept the recommendations.
Paul Farmer, who co-authored
, said mental health is still a taboo subject in many workplaces.
Mr Farmer, who is CEO of the mental health charity Mind, said: ""Opportunities are missed to prevent poor mental health and ensure that employees who may be struggling get the support they need.
""In many instances employers simply don't understand the crucial role they can play, or know where to go for advice and support.""
The review makes 40 recommendations about how employers and the government can better support employees to remain at work, such as through creating an online wellbeing portal and using digital technology to support workers in the gig economy.
Companies are also being encouraged to include a section on employee mental health in their annual reports. Currently only 11% of companies do this, the report found.
""Returning to work was just so frightening""
One employer the report praised is the insurer Aviva.
James Tringham has worked for them for seven years. He said the company helped him get his life back on track after it was crippled by his bipolar disorder:
""In 2009 I'd reached crisis point with my mental health, and I gave up my career as a solicitor.
""I was unable to work for over a year - the prospect of returning to work was just so frightening and not something that I could imagine.""
Eventually he got a job in the insurer's contact centre: ""They gave me a way back into employment and I have worked my way back up.
""Aviva have been brilliant in supporting me to manage my mental health at work, and have given me my confidence back.
""There's an understanding, which means little things like adjusting my workload when I'm feeling on the low side can really help. And the staff - both officially and unofficially - form a great support network.""
Aviva was one of a number of companies whose well-being strategy was praised in the report.
The review says employers should:
Create a mental health at work plan
Build mental health awareness by making information and support accessible
Encourage open conversations
Provide good working conditions and ensure employees have a healthy work-life balance
Promote effective people management, with line managers holding regular conversations about health and well-being with their staff
Routinely monitor employee mental health
The review also found employers lose up to £42bn each year due to staff suffering from mental health problems.
Mrs May is asking NHS England and the civil service - which together employ more than two million people - to implement the recommendations.
She said: ""It is only by making this an everyday concern for everyone that we change the way we see mental illness, so that striving to improve your mental health - whether at work or at home - is seen as just as positive as improving our physical well-being.""
The government said it is considering the legislative changes suggested.

"Netflix looks beyond US as competition mounts
Claire Foy has won awards for her portrayal of the Queen in the Netflix drama The Crown
Netflix has come a long way since it started as a mail-order DVD rental service. It has largely been responsible for dragging television into the online world and its dozens of original productions such as House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black have helped it win a huge global audience.
Last year its programming became available in another 130 countries, bringing the total to more than 190.
But Netflix faces increasing competition from online rivals such as Amazon and Hulu, while television networks start to launch their own streaming services and make new shows available in binge-ready box sets.
Sky Atlantic, for example, has made all six episodes of the new drama Guerrilla - starring Idris Elba, Freida Pinto and Babou Ceesay - available to stream, meaning viewers will not have to wait a week for their next fix.
Freida Pinto and Babou Ceesay in the Sky Atlantic drama Guerrilla
Growth of US subscriptions, which account for almost 60% of Netflix's revenue, has also slowed.
Analysts and investors will closely watch its subscriber growth when results for the most recent quarter are released later on Monday.
The company, whose shares have jumped almost 30% in the past 12 months to just over $140, is expected to report revenues of $2.5bn, with the subscriber total tantalisingly close to the 100 million mark.
But some question how long Netflix can continue adding customers at the same pace.
How will international expansion hold up?
Netflix had more than 44 million international subscribers at the end of 2016, nearly 50% higher than the year before, as well as 49 million in the US.
It expects to add another 4 million to the international total this quarter.
Formerly sceptical analysts are increasingly confident that the firm can deliver. A consumer survey conducted for Jefferies bank in Germany and India turned up the surprising finding that services such as Netflix and Amazon are more appealing than local streaming options, despite potential language barriers.
The survey also suggested that Netflix's pricing could hold up, even in a wider variety of markets.
However, the company has warned that growth could be hurt if the dollar climbs much higher.
Who is watching its shows?
Robin Wright stars in House of Cards
Netflix started making its own shows in 2013, with House of Cards one of its first big hits and Stranger Things more recently. The company plans to spend more on original content this year and reduce outlays on licensed material such as movies.
Awards and critical acclaim for dramas such as The Crown have helped attract viewers. Yet analysts at Jefferies fear that cutting back on other content such as films could reduce Netflix's overall appeal.
Will it be affected by the Hollywood writers dispute?
Netflix casts a long shadow on the negotiations that started in March between the Writers Guild of America and production companies and studios over what writers are paid. The existing agreement expires on 1 May and a strike could be on the cards.
One of the main sticking points concerns residual payments for streamed shows and writers for some Netflix productions are covered by the agreement.
The growth of online television has also contributed to the rise of shorter series than on broadcast networks, which has meant lower fees for writers.
Netflix stands to benefit from any disruption to major broadcasters. It also has flexibility to withstand a work stoppage, since it's not bound by the traditional TV calendar.

Snapchat has been registered with a Russian regulator
Snapchat's parent company says the US messaging app has been registered with Russia's technology regulator without its knowledge.
Snap told the BBC that the Roskomnadzor agency had unilaterally put it on its register of information distributors.
The move means Snapchat will be required to keep all messages for six months and make them accessible to the Russian security services.
Snap said it had no intention of complying with the rule.
A spokesman for the company said it had provided ""very basic contact information"" to Roskomnadzor, but ""not for the purpose of registering us"".
Snap is the first Western social media company to find itself on the list. Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger have not been added.
Russia's new data laws require ""information distribution organisers"" to register with the regulator and store users' data for six months. The requirements come into force next year.
Companies must also hand over their encryption keys when asked, in line with Russian anti-terror legislation.

"Michelle Rodriguez threatens to leave 'Fast & Furious' franchise
Updated 1622 GMT (0022 HKT) June 28, 2017
Michelle Rodriguez slammed the 'Fast and the Furious' franchise for its lack of female characters
She took to Instagram to say she's considering leaving her role as Letty Ortiz
Michelle Rodriguez is standing up for her female cast members.
The actress announced on Instagram that she is prepared to leave behind her beloved role as Letty Ortiz in the hit ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise due to its lack of strong female voices in the series.
""F8 is out digitally today,"" she wrote in the caption of her Instagram photo. ""I hope they decide to show some love to the women of the franchise on the next one or I just might have to say goodbye to a loved franchise. It's been a good ride & I'm grateful for the opportunity the fans & studio have provided over the years ... One Love.""
A post shared by Michelle Rodriguez (@mrodofficial) on
Jun 27, 2017 at 8:43am PDT
The franchise includes roles for award-winning actresses like Helen Mirren and Charlize Theron but it's still the men who dominate the movies as Rodriguez recently pointed out to
""On day one, I [changed] the character from being something that I could not do in front of millions of people into a character that I'm actually proud of, but at the end of the day, what message are we sending out there for women?"" she said. ""It does weigh heavy on my head -- especially in the male-dominated environment that I work in.""
Fans seem to agree with Rodriguez and immediately began praising her for speaking out.
King_alima wrote underneath Rodriguez's post: ""She has a point though we've never seen her and Mia talk in the entire franchise or have an all girl team up to save the guys or save any guy.""
While Serendipity.and.her commented: ""You are so right to fight for that Michelle. Fast 8 could have/ should have done so much more with Letty and Ramsey characters ( and do I even start with Mia?) - your action scenes were awesome and Letty and Dom's scenes together are beautiful, but that's not enough!""

"Michael Gove: Brexit 'consensus' needed after general election
The government needs to seek the ""maximum possible consensus"" on Brexit in the light of the general election result, Michael Gove says.
The new environment secretary, a leading figure in the campaign to leave the EU, said the referendum result should be ""honoured in the right way"".
The Tories no longer have a Commons majority with EU negotiations set to begin next week.
There have been calls for a cross-party commission to seek agreement.
, Former Conservative leader William Hague said a ""change of style and substance"" was now needed, suggesting a commission, also including business leaders and trade unions, to find areas of agreement.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has also called for a cross-party approach, and Labour's Yvette Cooper said a commission was needed to avoid Brexit being ""caught up in the inevitable Hung Parliament political rows"".
Theresa May set out the government's strategy last year as she started the clock on the UK's final departure from the EU.
Downing Street has said there will be no changes to this approach, despite the Tories looking like they will have to rely on the Democratic Unionist Party - which backs Brexit but has specific demands including close trade with the EU - to stay in power.
Mr Gove noted that most votes at the election had been cast for either the Conservatives or Labour, who both support leaving the EU and ending freedom of movement, but added: ""It is important to recognise we were not returned with a majority.""
The government should ""proceed with the maximum possible consensus"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, and ""make sure that Remainers' concerns are part of our conversation"".
Following reports of talks between some Remain-backing Conservative and Labour MPs, he rejected a ""softening"" of the government's approach, but said there were a ""significant number of questions as we leave about the shape that we want our country to take"".
But he played down Lord Hague's suggestion of a commission - ""this idea is very much his copyright"", he added.
Michael Gove denies he accused PM of failing to ""drain the swamp"" of Islamist extremism
Another ex-Tory leader, Iain Duncan Smith, dismissed suggestions of a change in the Conservatives' approach as ""made-up nonsense"".
He told the BBC the DUP had supported the government's strategy before the general election and ""the vast majority of the Conservative Party believes this is a settled issue"".
Mr Gove, who clashed with Mrs May when both were ministers and was then sacked by her when she arrived in Downing Street, declared himself a ""huge fan"" of the PM.
He also rejected criticism of his environmental credentials by some campaigners, saying he had spoken in 2006 in favour of a bill making it easier to fight climate change and attributing his later voting record to having been following the whip in government.
""My own approach has always been to argue for strong action to deal with man-made climate change,"" he added.

"Sir Bruce Forsyth: BBC considers permanent tribute
The BBC is considering a permanent memorial to Sir Bruce Forsyth, who died on Friday at the age of 89.
Amid the tributes to the entertainer,
of the entertainer to be erected outside a BBC building.
A spokesperson for the BBC said it would look into the idea of a memorial to mark his 75-year career.
""We are more than happy to look at what would be the most fitting tribute to a BBC showbiz legend.""
Councillors in Edmonton, north London - where he was born - are also said to be considering plans to commemorate the Strictly star with a permanent memorial.
Independent Edmonton councillor Nesimi Erbil
he would hope a statue or plaque would be agreed upon in the borough.
The former host of The Generation Game, Play Your Cards Right and The Price is Right started his career at the age of 14 and already has a number of permanent tributes.
A bust of Sir Bruce Forsyth already resides at the London Palladium
of the entertainer was unveiled at London's Palladium theatre, where he hosted TV's Sunday Night at the London Palladium in the 1950s and 60s.
There is also a special plaque celebrating his record-breaking number of appearances at The Hippodrome in London.
Funeral details for the star have not yet been announced.
On Sunday, his manager Ian Wilson said: ""The family have barely discussed let alone finalised arrangements. An announcement will be made in the coming days.""
The game show host had not been seen in public for a while before he died.
He stopped hosting Strictly in 2014, and in 2015 he had keyhole surgery after suffering two aneurysms. His health had deteriorated recently after he contracted bronchial pneumonia.

"Lena Dunham undergoes hysterectomy after chronic pain
Lena Dunham has had many operations to ease her pain
Lena Dunham has revealed she has undergone a total hysterectomy following years of suffering from the condition endometriosis.
The actress explained her decision in a deeply personal essay for the March edition of
said she had been ""battling endometriosis for a decade"", adding: ""This will be my ninth surgical procedure.""
The 31-year-old said, however, that she still hopes to one day become a mother.
""I may have felt choiceless before, but I know I have choices now,"" she said.
""Soon I'll start exploring whether my ovaries, which remain someplace inside me in that vast cavern of organs and scar tissue, have eggs.
""Adoption is a thrilling truth I'll pursue with all my might.""
Dunham admitted, however, that after the surgery she had started a process of ""mourning"" over the sure knowledge she would now never be able to carry a child.
Dunham described her uterus as the ""Chinatown Chanel purse of nightmares"".
Endometriosis is a condition which means tissues that should line the uterus begin to grow outside.
It often leads to pain and other complications in the woman affected, which, in some cases, become extreme.
Dunham also said the surgery had revealed her uterus was ""worse than anyone could have imagined. It's the Chinatown Chanel purse of nightmares"".
A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the womb (uterus).
Hysterectomies are carried out to treat conditions that affect the female reproductive system.
What does the surgery involve?:
The womb is removed and the patient may also have her cervix or ovaries removed, depending on her personal circumstances.
Is every hysterectomy the same?:
There are various types of hysterectomy procedure depending on why the patient needs the operation and on personal medical advice.
""In addition to endometrial disease, an odd hump-like protrusion and a septum running down the middle, I have retrograde bleeding, aka my period running in reverse so that my stomach is full of blood,"" she added.
""My ovary has settled in on the muscles around the sacral nerves in my back that allow us to walk.
""Let's please not even talk about my uterine lining. The only beautiful detail is that the organ - which is meant to be shaped like a light bulb - was shaped like a heart.""
Lena Dunham fell ill at last year's Met Gala in New York
Dunham was admitted to hospital at least three times in a year due to endometriosis and had a surgical procedure on her ovaries in April.
She afterwards said she was clear of the condition but it returned in May. She had been attending the Met Gala in New York - one of the biggest celebrity events of the year - when she was rushed to hospital.
She later had to cancel her Lenny: America IRL tour. She told fans she was in ""the greatest amount of physical pain that I have ever experienced"".
The actress is well-known for speaking out about her own issues and those of others.
(it hadn't), and had earlier in 2017

However, she has also had to go back on her public comments after causing a backlash against her.
In November she had to apologise for
Dunham initially said she was ""confident"" the accusation had been ""misreported"" but later said it was the wrong time to make such a statement.
She is also well-known for her support of women's rights and runs the website

"Toronto Film Festival: George Clooney 'felt sick' shooting Suburbicon
Entertainment reporter at the Toronto Film Festival
George Clooney is the director of Suburbicon - currently showing at the Toronto Film Festival
George Clooney has said he ""felt sick"" while directing some scenes in his new movie Suburbicon.
The film's plot sees a black family move into a predominantly white suburban community in the 1950s.
""The trickiest part [of shooting] was, we were in a very racially diverse neighbourhood in Fullerton, California,"" Clooney said.
""And we had about 350 extras who were going to hurl a lot of racial slurs and say a lot of pretty terrible things.""
Clooney added: ""Everybody who was making the film, we all just felt sick while we were doing it.""
Julianne Moore and Matt Damon (pictured) star in Suburbicon
Referring to the way the family is treated in the film, the director said: ""These are things that happened - [neighbours] sang church hymns, they hung confederate flags over the fence, they built a fence around their house, these are things that really happened.
""But it was sickening to be part of it quite honestly, so that was one of the most difficult things to shoot.""
The movie, which is currently showing as part of the Toronto Film Festival, was conceived during the run up to the US election of November 2016, which was won by Donald Trump.
Clooney said: ""We'd seen some things on the campaign trail where they were talking about building fences, and scapegoating Mexicans and Muslims, and we're always reminded that these aren't new things and new moments in our history.
""So we thought it would be interesting to talk about it, but we wanted the film to be entertaining, not a documentary, we didn't want it to be an eat-your-spinach piece of filmmaking.
L-R: Karimah Westbrook, George Clooney, Julianne Moore and Matt Damon
""So we merged it with [an existing Coen Brothers script] Suburbicon, because we thought it was a funnier idea to put it in the suburbs in the 1950s where we all thought everything was perfect - if you were a white straight male.""
The actor and director said the real-life political climate the film was shot in ultimately altered the tone of the movie.
""While we were shooting, Trump was elected, and it changed the temperature of the film in a weird way,"" Clooney explained.
""The country got angrier, whichever side you were on. We had to cut some of Josh Brolin's scenes out, and one of the reasons is they were really slapstick funny, and it felt like the wrong tone suddenly.""
The film stars Matt Damon, Julianne Moore and Karimah Westbrook - who drew parallels between her character (the mother of the African-America family) and her own experience of the entertainment industry.
""I think early on there was a lot of correlations a far as what I've experienced in Hollywood,"" she said.
Karimah Westbrook said diversity in Hollywood had improved more recently
""I wore my hair natural for a very long time, so when I first moved to Hollywood I had an afro, and my manager said 'You'll never work with your hair like that, you'll have to straighten it'.
""I struggled with that for years, my looks, my hair... but I feel like things have changed so much in the industry, we have so many African-American women starring in shows now, so I feel there's been progress, but there's still a lot of things were facing on both sides.""

"Gothenburg vs. AIK: Swedish football hit by match-fixing claim
Updated 1221 GMT (2021 HKT) May 18, 2017
The home ground of AIK is the Friends Arena in Stockholm, Sweden.
Gothenburg vs. AIK postponed
Postponed due to match-fixing claim
It's been one of the scourges of modern sport in recent years and now the possibility of a match being fixed has prompted the postponement of a leading European soccer match.
Thursday's match between Gothenburg and AIK was postponed after a player from the Stockholm club was reportedly ""offered a considerable sum"" earlier in the week if he ""actively contributed"" to his team losing the game, according to the Swedish Football Association.
""This is a very serious attack on Swedish football and we will never, never accept,"" said SFA general secretary Håkan Sjöstrand.
The match in Sweden's Allsvenskan league was set to take place at Gothenburg's Gamla Ullevi stadium, but all the relevant parties have agreed to the postponement as police start an investigation.
""It is ultimately not about a single match, therefore it is important we act forcefully,"" added Sjostrand.
""The starting point for all of our games is that they are safe and settled on sporting grounds. Based on the information we have, we cannot guarantee that.""
AIK are sixth in the Allsvenskan, five places above Gothenburg.

Uber lost its private hire licence
Uber will not be issued a new private hire licence, Transport for London (TfL) has said.
TfL has concluded the ride-hailing app firm was not fit and proper to hold a private hire operator licence.
Uber's approach and conduct demonstrated a lack of corporate responsibility which could have potential public safety and security implications, it said.
Uber has 21 days to appeal, during which it can continue to operate.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said in a statement: ""I fully support TfL's decision - it would be wrong if TfL continued to license Uber if there is any way that this could pose a threat to Londoners' safety and security.""

"John Boyega and Amber Riley lead nominations at The Stage Debut Awards
You might know them best from Glee and Star Wars - but it's Amber Riley and John Boyega's performances on the London stage which have bagged them nominations for a top industry award.
Both are up for the Joe Allen Best West End Debut prize at the inaugural
It recognises a debut performance in the West End, with the winner decided by a public vote.
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child's Anthony Boyle is also nominated.
The other nominees for the prize are:
Audra McDonald, Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill
Andrew Polec, Bat Out of Hell
Imogen Poots, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
Charlie Stemp, Half a Sixpence
""It's great to see such a range of talented theatre makers and gives cause for great optimism about the future of theatre in the UK,"" said The Stage's associate editor, Lyn Gardner.
Boyle plays Scorpius Malfoy in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child
Mark Shenton, The Stage's associate editor and one of the judges, said: ""While the other categories in The Stage Debut Awards only recognise complete newcomers, the Joe Allen Best West End Debut Award is a chance to celebrate talent making their mark in the West End for the first time.
""We have a really great shortlist that ranges from genuine newcomers like Anthony Boyle, who made his professional debut in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, to Audra McDonald, a legend on Broadway making her belated West End debut in Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill.""
Boyega made his West End debut as the lead in Woyzeck, with Riley appearing as Effie White in Dreamgirls.
Switching space for the Cold War,
for his performance in the modern adaptation of George Buchner's unfinished play set in 1980s Berlin.
Riley took on the role played by Jennifer Hudson in the 2006 Dreamgirls film - having previously performed one of its songs, And I am Telling You I'm Not Going, in the first series of Glee.

it felt ""exceptional"" to be in a show where the three leads were black women.
She said: ""I think it's incredible. In theatre, I feel like you want to see people that look like you and know that you can do that.

World No. 4 is favorite for French Open title
Simona Halep is enjoying a wonderful clay court season.
Earlier this month the world No. 4 became the first player since Serena Williams to successfully defend her Madrid Open title.
The Romanian is the in-form player on the red dirt and, unsurprisingly, is the bookmakers' favorite to win the French Open, which starts on May 28.
Should she triumph in Paris, it would be her first grand slam.
But what is the secret behind the 25-year-old's success on the clay this year? A little bit of chocolate mousse every day, she says.
""I love chocolate and I loved to have chocolate mousse in Madrid,"" Halep, who tops the WTA's
""I always have few a day and the story was that I had it before the matches. I had a chocolate mousse before the final and after. I just love chocolate mousse and they have it in Paris as well.
""I'm gonna continue it every day so I'm eating a little bit of chocolate every day.""
Halep '50-50' for Roland Garros
Victory over France's Kristina Mladenovic in the Spanish capital secured Halep -- the first female player to reach three Madrid finals -- a first title of the season.
She reached the final of last week's Italian Open, but suffered an ankle injury when leading Elina Svitolina 5-2 in the first set and went on to lose in three.
A post shared by Simona Halep (@simonahalep) on
May 24, 2017 at 2:04am PDT
The Romanian said on Instagram Wednesday that she had torn a ligament and was ""50-50"" for Roland Garros.
""We are remaining very positive,"" she wrote, after arriving early in Paris for treatment.
In the absence of high-profile stars, organizers will hope Halep recovers for Sunday's opener.
World No. 2 Serena Williams, who is expecting her first child, will not return to the Tour until 2018 and the American's maternity leave has opened up the women's draw in Paris, which has very few previous grand slam winners.
Two-time grand slam winner Victoria Azarenka is not scheduled to return to the Tour until next month after giving birth to her son, Leo, last year.
And Maria Sharapova will not be competing in Paris after organizers denied the two-time champion a wild card following her return from a doping ban.
'I'm a different player now'
But should Halep's ankle heal, the fourth seed will not be thinking of lifting Coupe Suzanne Lenglen.
""It means a lot that I could win the Madrid Open, but it doesn't mean that I'm thinking to win, or that I have a chance to win, the French Open,"" says Halep, who will play Jana Cepelova in the first round, should the Romanian be fit.
""I'm not thinking that at all. I just want to take this tournament as important as Madrid was, to play every match as good as I can and to win every match I play. But I'm not thinking about the results.
""Of course, I'm confident now after Madrid.""

Andy Murray: I've been getting better on clay
In 2014, the Romanian reached the final at Roland Garros, but was beaten in three sets by Sharapova.
Halep says she is a stronger player than the one who reached her only grand slam final three years ago.
Who is your favorite to win the French Open?
""I'm a different player a little bit,"" she says. ""I feel stronger mentally and physically. I think I also changed some things in my game. I'm older, I am more mature but, yeah, you can never compare the results and the years.
""I'm trying just to do my best every tournament I play. We're gonna see. I really wish to play again in the final day in the French Open.""

"Bitcoin approaches $10,000 a piece
Virtual currency Bitcoin is at a record high of $9,700 after jumping 4.5% so far on Monday.
The move takes it to 20% above the level it stood at on Friday, according to the
It started the year at around $1,000.
Virtual currencies are largely unregulated and bypass traditional banking systems. Their growth is of increasing concern to international regulators.
China and South Korea have banned any new virtual currency launches and have been shutting down exchanges on which they are traded.
JP Morgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, described Bitcoin at a recent conference as ""a fraud"".
""It's just not a real thing, eventually it will be closed,"" he said.
Currencies such as Bitcoin use
of anonymous computers on the internet.
They are not backed by any government, nor central bank and therefore there is no-one responsible for backing their value.
European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters news agency that Bitcoin ""could easily blow up, and central banks could then be accused of not doing anything.
""So we're trying to understand whether bank activity in relation to crypto-currency trading needs to be better regulated.""
Analysis, Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent:
This has felt like the latest, maddest speculative bubble, a tulip fever for the hi-tech era.
On its helter skelter ride towards $10,000, there have been plenty of occasions where Bitcoin has seemed in trouble - splits in the community over how it should be governed, robberies at exchanges, warnings from regulators.
But every time that pundits have warned the bubble is about to burst, the currency has stuttered for a few days and then gone charging higher.
Some banks are looking at whether the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies could be of use to them as the world moves further away from cash transactions.
The world's leading derivatives exchange, the CME, said recently it planned to offer trading in Bitcoin futures in the near future, although it has not yet set a date.
The potential involvement of CME has spurred the price of Bitcoin higher.
Jameel Ahmad, from Cyprus-based online foreign exchange broker, FXTM, said: ""This rise appears to have been triggered by hopes the CME move will bring in investment from hedge funds and other major investors and move Bitcoin into the mainstream.""
Bitcoin is particularly susceptible to rumour. Mr Ahmad said there is also talk that Amazon is considering accepting Bitcoin as payment.
There is also concern that Bitcoin could be vulnerable to hackers.
Mr Ahmad said that recently it lost almost 20% in value on fears it was being hacked.

"Sam Claflin: It's ok to be scared or weak
Star of Journey's End, Sam Claflin on male mental health.
Journey's End, a story set in the trenches at the end of the First World War, may not on the surface sound relevant to an audience today.
Hunger Games star Sam Claflin, who stars in its latest film adaptation, thinks this couldn't be further from the truth.
His character, Captain Stanhope, heads up an infantry unit in the British army, staving off Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with a large amount of whisky.
The display of a man failing to confront his mental health problems was just as much of an issue in 1918 as it is in 2018.
Claflin plays Captain Stanhope in Journey's End
""With Stanhope there's so much more responsibility on his shoulders, he's hit harder and is so much younger than the others who have lived a life,"" Claflin tells the BBC.
""He's in charge of 100 men and that's only the 100 men that are living at that time, not to speak of the men who have died during the three years he's been there.""
""It's ok to be scared or a bit weak""
Claflin, whose career has seen him play everything from an aristocrat's son in The Riot Club to a quadriplegic in Me Before You, spent time with four ex-servicemen suffering from PTSD to prepare for his role in the film.
""For me it was a really eye-opening experience and one I hope resonates with a younger audience,"" he says.
""Nowadays I think many men are a lot more open to their emotions and feelings and expressing them, but at that time you wouldn't see a genuine intimacy between men.""
The 31-year-old adds that he's excited by how conversations around male mental health are changing.
""It's ok to be afraid and to be anxious or scared or a bit weak - that doesn't make your more or less of a man.""
Claflin spent time with four ex-servicemen to discuss PTSD
Claflin's interview takes place at a time when the film industry is under immense scrutiny.
With his previous roles in the Pirates of the Caribbean and Hunger Games franchises, he has a lot to say about working in Hollywood and specifically the treatment of women.
""There's always the pressure in any industry to be the perfect role model, but it's changing and I think it's good we're having this discussion,"" he says.
""The role of man has changed drastically and thankfully the role of the woman is coming on to an equal playing field.""
Claflin starred in Me Before You, directed by Thea Sharrock.
Claflin says that in his career to date, ""over half of the jobs I've done have been led by a woman, have been directed by a woman, produced and written by a woman.""
He also says that in his experience, the expectations of men and women in the industry are totally different when it comes to body image.
""There was a recent job I did and I needed to lose weight for it, but before the director had even discussed it, I looked at the script and read that he was topless a lot and he was very athletic,"" he says.
""I knew what was expected of me and that's the difference between men and women - it's not necessary for a woman to do that.
""I've heard some stories of what women have been through and it's different.""
Claflin played Finnick Odair in The Hunger Games franchise
Claflin hopes that this marks the beginning of a change in the film industry, which sees it become more inclusive.
One of his most memorable roles was in Me Before You, the romantic drama adapted from Jojo Moyes' successful novel.
His role as a city banker who became paralysed after a motorcycle accident sparked a debate during its release about able-bodied actors playing people with a disability.
""I'm an actor, I'm not really a soldier with PTSD or a pirate, or a footballer but I've played those characters and pretend to be things I'm not,"" is Claflin's response.
""In terms of me being a non-disabled actor playing someone disabled, there are aspects of the film where he is not disabled too.""
Claflin starred alongside Emelia Clarke in Me Before You
He says that what should come out debates like this is more opportunities for disabled actors.
""Often there's a sequel and a prequel as opposed to fresh, new idea.
""Someone should come up with a brand new idea rather than shift the ones that are already there.
""I think this is an exciting time for our generation, there are people with brilliant minds who are wanting to have their voices heard so this is a brilliant change.""

"UN says Prevent extremism policy is 'inherently flawed'
A UN Human Rights Council report has criticised the Prevent counter-terror strategy as ""inherently flawed.""
Prevent is a UK government scheme that uses early intervention to try to stop people from becoming radicalised.
The report said the policy was ""inconsistent with the principle of the rule of law"".
Home Secretary Amber Rudd set out plans to improve and strengthen Prevent in the wake of last month's Manchester terror attack.
She suggested more money would be spent on the strategy to make sure ""it has even more effective outcomes in communities to protect us"".
She said Prevent had helped stop 150 people - including 50 children - from leaving Britain to fight in Syria in the last year.
Prevent, which was set up in 2006 by Labour, is meant to protect individuals thought to be at risk of being radicalised has been criticised for demonising Muslim communities and deterring people from sharing information with police.
'Unpredictable and arbitrary'
The report by the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association in the UK, first published in May, was highly critical of Prevent, UK counter-terror legislation, the impact of lobbying laws on charities, and trade union laws.
The author of the report, Kenyan human rights specialist Maina Kiai, said unclear Prevent guidelines gave decision makers ""excessive discretion"", which rendered the application of the policy ""unpredictable and potentially arbitrary"".
This, he said, risked ""dividing, stigmatizing and alienating segments of the population"".
Legislation covering political lobbying also came in for criticism for having a chilling effect on charities.
Commonly known as the Lobbying Act, the laws were described as having a disproportionate effect upon civil society and trade unions compared to business interests.
This was, the report said, because the actions of in-house lobbyists, who generally work for these business interests, were not restricted by part one of the Act.
The report also criticises the implementation of counter-terrorism policies.
It said that the Investigatory Powers Act, which increased government powers to intercept private communications, ""contained procedures without adequate oversight, coupled with overly broad definitions, which might result in unduly interfering with the right to privacy, the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to freedom of association.""
It criticised the planned Counter Extremism and Safeguarding Bill, which would allow clamp downs on non-violent extremist groups, as unnecessary, saying it could leave people ""fearful of exercising their rights"" and could end up proving counterproductive.
Balloting restrictions on public service trade unions to force higher turnout before industrial action could be taken, introduced under the Trade Union Act, were labelled as ""profoundly undemocratic"".
Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael said: ""This report is right, Theresa May's Prevent strategy has become discredited and must now be replaced.""
""As we have seen with recent terrorist attacks, local communities alerted the authorities about suspicious individuals but their warnings were ignored.""
""We need a new approach, working closely with communities to root out extremism and investing in local policing and intelligence-gathering.""
President of the National Union of Students, Malia Bouattia, said: ""We welcome this report as yet another confirmation that the Prevent agenda is seriously flawed and undermines people's civil liberties.
""NUS and others have long maintained that the Prevent strategy is not only damaging to those it targets but that it is completely ineffective as a counter-terrorism strategy.
""Unclear guidelines result in over-zealous and misinformed staff reporting everyone from PhD students studying counter-terrorism to four year old children.""
Greenpeace UK's executive director John Sauven said: ""The Lobbying Act has done nothing to curb the influence of corporate lobbies over our political system, but has frightened charities supported by millions of people into silence.
""Ministers should listen to the UN and to their own experts and use the Queen's Speech to repeal or reform this charity-gagging law.""

"Tesla recalls 53,000 cars over brake issue
Tesla has issued a voluntary global recall for some of its Model S and Model X cars to fix a problem with the parking brake.
The electric car maker said about 2% of the 53,000 vehicles built from February to October 2016 were affected, but all of those cars are being recalled.
The company added it had no reports of accidents or injuries relating to the brake issue.
In US trading, Tesla shares closed down 1% at $302.51.
the firm said the electric parking brakes installed on Model S and Model X ""may contain a small gear that could have been manufactured improperly by our third-party supplier"".
If the gear were to break, the parking brake would continue to keep the car from moving, but the parking brake would be stuck in place, it added.
Tesla said there had been no reports of parking brake failure, and said it was ""safe to continue regular use of your vehicle.""
The company will be sending an official recall notice to customers, with information on how the parking brakes could be replaced.
In 2013, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a US federal government agency, awarded the Tesla Model S a
, and said the vehicle ""set a new record for the lowest likelihood of injury to occupants"".
The company issued a voluntary recall for 3,000 of its Model S cars in
, due to seatbelt connectivity problems.
Elon Musk has strong backing from investors - but needs to hit ambitious targets this year
Tesla produced a total of 83,922 vehicles in 2016, including the Model S and Model X.
Earlier this week chief executive Elon Musk said Tesla would unveil an electric articulated lorry in September. Additionally, he said an electric pick-up truck would be shown off in the next two years.
Last year Mr Musk expressed the firm's desire to branch out beyond cars, but analysts are concerned the company will not meet demand for its current projects.
The Model 3, a more mid-market car compared with Tesla's current offerings, has 400,000 pre-orders which is vastly more than the company can manufacture in a year. It is due to go into production later this year.
The basic model will start at $35,000 (Â£28,500) and have a range of at least 215 miles (346km) per charge.
Tesla faces competition from other similarly priced electric cars that will become available first, including General Motors' Chevy Bolt and BYD's Qin EV300.

"Fyre Festival faces $100m 'Lord of the Flies' lawsuit
The organisers of the disastrous Fyre Festival have been hit with a $100m (Â£78m) lawsuit by one of the attendees.
The event was cancelled after squalid conditions were

American rapper Ja Rule, whose real name is Jeffrey Atkins, and his business partner Billy McFarland, are being sued for fraud, negligent representation and breach of contract.
to all the festival-goers.
Attendee Daniel Jung, who has enlisted the services of celebrity trial lawyer Mark Geragos, is accusing the pair of ""an outrageous failure to prepare"".
""The festival's lack of adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees - suddenly finding themselves stranded on a remote island without basic provisions - that was closer to The Hunger Games or Lord of the Flies than Coachella,"" the court filing said.
""The Fyre Festival was nothing more than a get-rich-quick scam from the very beginning,"" it alleged.
over the weekend, Fyre organisers said ""the team was overwhelmed"".
""They simply weren't ready for what happened next, or how big this thing would get,"" it said.
Ja Rule also posted on social media that he was ""heartbroken"", insisting the event was not a scam.
""I truly apologise as this is not my fault... but I'm taking responsibility,"" he tweeted.
The Fyre Festival marketed itself as a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" musical experience in the Bahamas with beach cabanas and gourmet cuisine.
Tickets to the two-weekend event on Great Exuma Island in the Bahamas, cost from $1,200 to over $100,000. Up to 7,000 people were expected to attend.
It launched on Instagram with a video featuring models Bella Hadid, Hailey Baldwin and Emily Ratajkowski sailing on a luxury yacht.
Famous models were used to promote ""the next Coachella"" on Instagram
But instead, festival-goers have complained about a ""complete disaster"" after many were stranded for hours without food, water or shelter.
The court filing described their luggage as being ""unceremoniously dumped from shipping containers and left for them to rifle through"".
The lawsuit also alleges Fyre's organisers warned musicians and celebrities not to attend the festival but ""refused to warn attendees about the dangerous conditions awaiting them on the island"".
Blink-182, who were set to be headlining, pulled out on Thursday. Major Lazer, Skepta and Disclosure were also set to perform.

"ECHR court reverses ruling on sacking over private messages
Technology reporter, BBC News
The European Court of Human Rights is in Strasbourg
A Romanian man should not have been fired for sending private messages at work, Europe's top human rights court has ruled.
Bogdan Mihai Barbulescu was sacked for sending the messages via the Yahoo messaging system in 2007.
His employer had used surveillance software to monitor his computer activity.
A Romanian court ruled in 2016 that the firm was within its rights but this has now been overturned.
Mr Barbulescu successfully challenged the original decision.
Some of the communications he had sent were ""intimate in nature"" and were sent to his brother and his fiancee, the court heard.
However, his right to privacy had not been ""adequately protected"", the apex body of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has now ruled.
The ECHR also said it was not clear whether Mr Barbulescu had been warned that his communications would be monitored, and that the original court had not established specifically why the monitoring had taken place.
As it is the highest court there can be no further appeal.
""...although it was questionable whether Mr Barbulescu could have had a reasonable expectation of privacy in view of his employer's restrictive regulations on internet use, of which he had been informed, an employer's instructions could not reduce private social life in the workplace to zero,"" said the court in its decision.
, the ECHR says the ruling does not mean that firms cannot now monitor employee communications at work, and that they can still dismiss employees for private use.
""However, the Court considers that States should ensure that, when an employer takes measures to monitor employees' communications, these measures are accompanied by adequate and sufficient safeguards against abuse,"" it said.
Catrina Smith, employment partner at the legal firm Norton Rose said it would not have a huge impact on UK employment regulation.
""What it will do, for companies who thought they had a bit more leeway than they did, is confirm the fact that they don't,"" she said.
""It will hopefully remind employers that they need to think about these issues and be very clear with employees about what is and isn't permissible.
""Employees also need to be smarter about the way in which they use both personal and work devices.""
Ms Smith added that in the UK both the Data Protection Act and the Interception of Communications Act set out clear guidelines for employers regarding what they can monitor.
""You have to make sure the employee understands that [monitoring] might happen and you have to have a good reason for doing so,"" she said.
""It's all about having a dialogue and having an agreement about what is and isn't personal.""
There also needs to be clear guidelines about the use of personal devices for work purposes, she added.
""In the old days if you took papers home, they still belonged to the employer,"" she said.
""You need to have clear understanding of the amount of ownership an employer has over information held on a personal device.""

"Theresa May tells Conservative Party conference, 'Let's shape up'
Theresa May will tell the Conservatives to ""shape up"" and ""go forward together"" as she closes her annual party conference on Wednesday.
The PM, who has faced repeated questions about her leadership during the Manchester conference, will vow not to ""retreat in the face of difficulty"".
And she will tell colleagues not to worry about their own jobs, but about those of ""ordinary working people"".
They must look ""do our duty by Britain"", she will say.
Having seen her Commons majority vanish after June's general election and faced calls to sack Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson over his interventions on Brexit, Mrs May has tried to use the conference to unite the party behind her ""mission"" to transform Britain.
On Tuesday she told the BBC she still had the authority to lead her party and insisted Mr Johnson's comments had not undermined her.
In her conference speech, her second as party leader, she will call on the party to ""dig deep within ourselves"" and go forward together.
""None of this will be easy,"" she will say.
""There will be obstacles and barriers along the way.
""But it has never been my style to hide from a challenge, to shrink from a task, to retreat in the face of difficulty, to give up and turn away.
""And it is when tested the most that we reach deep within ourselves and find that our capacity to rise to the challenge before us may well be limitless.
Theresa May is asked if Boris Johnson has undermined her
""That is the story of our party. That is the story of our country. And that is the resolve and determination we need as we turn to face the future today.""
Urging her party to focus on the needs of working people, she will say it should be ""not addressing our concerns, but the issues, the problems, the challenges, that concern them"", and ""not focusing on our future, but on the future of their children and their grandchildren - doing everything we can to ensure their tomorrow will be better than our today"".

"Royal Mail's new electric vans unveiled
The new vehicles will be trialled from today
Royal Mail is beginning trials in London of nine fully electric vans with ranges of up to 100 miles.
The vehicles, which come in various sizes, will distribute post from the central London depot.
They were produced by Oxfordshire-based carmaker Arrival, which recently opened a new factory in Banbury.
Another batch of 100 electric vans for Royal Mail has also been ordered from Peugeot.
Having already been trialled by Royal Mail, these will enter service in December.
Arrival says the nine vehicles it has supplied come in sizes of three and a half, six and seven and a half tonnes.
The new electric vans - one of the smaller ones is shown here in a digital render - have a range of up to 100 miles
Although the current prototype versions of the vans are fitted with wing mirrors, a spokeswoman for Arrival told the BBC they will be removed from the final design - as cameras will be used to monitor traffic to the rear instead.
Royal Mail was ""delighted"" to be collaborating with Arrival, said Paul Gatti, Royal Mail Fleet's managing director.
""We will be putting them through their paces over the next several months to see how they cope with the mail collection demands from our larger sites,"" he added.
Royal Mail's fleet comprises about 49,000 vehicles in total.
""European postal providers, starting with DHL in Germany, have been taking this approach for a while now,"" said Ananth Srinivasan, a mobility expert with research consultancy Frost & Sullivan.
He added that five countries - the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain - had the potential to convert significant proportions of their fleets to electric vehicles in the coming years.
""Our research indicates that by 2025 these countries may have 100,000 postal service vehicles going electric between them,"" he told the BBC.

"Fox triple-dog dares you not to love its next live musical
Updated 1959 GMT (0359 HKT) May 12, 2017
The cast of the Broadway music ""A Christmas Story,"" performs on GOOD MORNING AMERICA, 12/5/12, airing on the ABC Television Network.
Fox will celebrate the holidays this year with a musical version of a film so classic that it turned pink bunny pajamas, BB guns and leg lamps into symbols of Christmas.
The network announced Friday it will partner with Warner Horizon for a live musical production of ""A Christmas Story.""
Marc Platt, who this week also boarded NBC's upcoming live version of ""Jesus Christ Superstar,"" is set to head-up the event.
""La La Land"" songwriting duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, recent Tony Award nominees for the musical ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" will write several new songs for Fox's production. The two also scored ""A Christmas Story: The Musical,"" which was nominated for three Tony Awards.
The musical is based on the 1983 film about a boy whose Christmas wish is to get a BB gun for Christmas -- much to the chagrin of his parents.
TBS, which like CNN is owned by Turner, has made a tradition out of airing the film for 24 hours around Christmas, helping the film achieve cult status.
""'A Christmas Story' is one of the most beloved holiday films of all time -- audiences have made a yearly ritual of re-watching it -- and we are so thrilled to have Marc leading the charge in bringing the musical version of that film to television,"" said David Madden, President of entertainment at Fox Broadcasting Company in a statement.
The three-hour live television production of ""A Christmas Story"" will air this December on FOX.

She added: ""Occasionally Alex is not as funny as he thinks he is, and perhaps this is an example of a joke which belongs more in the Benny Hill era than in the modern era.""

"Trump threat to NFL over 'massive' tax breaks
US President Donald Trump has called for the National Football League (NFL) to be stripped of tax advantages.
In a tweet he complained the league had received ""massive"" tax breaks, while some of its players had been ""disrespecting"" the national anthem.
The teams pay tax, but have often received public support to build stadiums.
The NFL league office, which oversees rules, referees and the college draft, gave up its tax-exempt status in 2015.
Mr Trump has criticised players sharply for the protests and pressed the NFL to ban them.
Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)
End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump
On Tuesday, US Vice-President Mike Pence walked out of an NFL game after several players refused to stand.
Mr Pence said he could not be present at an event that ""disrespects our soldiers, our flag"" after abandoning the game in his home state of Indiana.
President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked Mr Pence to leave if players kneeled and said he was ""proud of him"".
Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the protest when he sat down as the Star-Spangled Banner played during a pre-season game in 2016.
He explained his gesture, which later became known as taking a knee, was meant to highlight racial injustice and police brutality against African Americans.
Angered by Mr Trump's comments on the issue, dozens of other players have joined the protest.

"Lego wins first copyright case against China copies
Lego fiercely protects its copyright over its famous coloured toy bricks and figurines
Lego says it has won a landmark copyright case in China against rival products almost identical to its famous coloured toy bricks.
It is the first time the Danish toymaker has won a competition case against Chinese copycats.
The imitation products were manufactured under the name Bela and were sold by two Chinese companies.
The victory follows an earlier ruling that Lego's name and logo are well-known trademarks in China.
Peter Thorslund Kjær, vice president of legal affairs in the Lego Group, said the latest ruling was ""a strong indication of the continued focus on proper intellectual property protection and enforcement by the Chinese courts"".
""We think this is very important for the continued development of a favourable business environment for all companies operating in the Chinese market.""
The court ruling was issued in September but did not take effect until November when the appeal window ended.
Lego copycats fool China boss
Firms making copycat versions have been a big problem for Lego as some of them are so convincing even Lego's China boss could not tell them apart when tested by the BBC earlier this year.

Lego sees China as having ""massive upside potential"" and has shown it will fiercely protect its brand.

"NHS parking charges: Hospitals made £174m in a year
Hospitals in England collected more than £174m in car parking fees in the last year
Hospitals in England made a record £174m last year in charging for parking, an investigation has found.
The figure for 2016-17 was 6% up on the previous financial year, data collected by the Press Association under the Freedom of Information Act showed.
The figures also showed a growing amount of revenue being made from fines - up by a third to £950,000.
The system has been branded a ""tax on sickness"", but hospitals said charging was needed and money made reinvested.
Car parking is largely free in Scotland and Wales.
PA obtained data from 111 hospital trusts out of the 120 they approached on charges for patients, visitors and staff.
Half of all trusts charged disabled people for parking in some or all of their disabled parking spaces
The Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust took the most money - over £4.8m
Two-thirds made more than £1m in each of the last three years
The most expensive place for a one-hour stay was the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford at £4
Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb said: ""The vast sums of money that hospitals are making from parking charges reveal the hidden cost of healthcare faced by many patients and their families.
""Hospital car park charges amount to a tax on sickness, with people who are chronically ill or disabled bearing the brunt.""
Parking 'unfair and unnecessary'
Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, added: ""Hospital parking charges are an entirely unfair and unnecessary burden, which disproportionately affect the most vulnerable people.""
Rachel Power, chief executive of the Patients Association, said the current state of NHS finances meant it was sometimes hard to blame hospitals for trying to find money.
But she said that did not make the current situation acceptable.
""For patients, parking charges amount to an extra charge for being ill,"" she said.
Hospitals have defended their approach to charging. Those in urban areas believe the parking will be used by shoppers without having a system of charging, while the money raised is used to maintain car parks, grounds and - in some cases - reinvested in patient care.
Concessions are available in many places for those who need to make repeat visits, such as chemotherapy patients.
A Department of Health spokesman said charges were a matter for local hospitals.
But he added: ""We want to see them coming up with flexible options that put patients and their families first.""

"Mass extinctions 'offer cautionary tale'
Lystrosaurus, an early relative of mammals
Mass extinctions have the potential to guide modern conservation efforts, say scientists.
A study confirms the idea that upheavals of the geological past caused a drastic loss of biodiversity.
''Disaster faunas'' dominated by a small number of widespread, newly-evolving species prevailed for millions of years.
Researchers warn that a sixth mass extinction is underway, which is predicted to have similar effects.
''These common trends observed in the fossil record have the potential to inform modern conservation efforts, given that the current biodiversity crisis is acknowledged as representing another mass extinction event,'' say the experts.
Their work is published in the journal Nature Communications.
The study analysed long-term changes in biodiversity in the supercontinent Pangaea, which incorporated almost all of the land masses on Earth.
The scientists traced the history of almost 900 animal species living between about 260 million and 175 million years ago.
This period witnessed two mass extinctions and the origins of mammals, dinosaurs, crocodiles and turtles.
The mass extinction about 252 million years ago was the largest in the Earth's history, in which 70% of land-living animals went extinct.
One of the most common animals around this time was
, an early relative of mammals, which lived in what is now Russia, China, India, Africa and Antarctica.
Fossils suggest the land-dwelling, plant-eating vertebrate dominated the Earth after many other animals went extinct.
After each mass extinction, animal communities across the globe were more similar than before, with short-lived species - so-called ""disaster fauna"" - becoming widespread.
""Much like in history, the past offers cautionary tales and context for our ongoing future,'' said lead researcher David Button of the University of Birmingham.
''The lesson from the past is that mass extinctions have big impacts beyond just species loss.''
Scientists have warned that a sixth mass extinction in Earth's history is underway as wildlife is lost to habitat destruction, overhunting, pollution, climate change and invasive species.

"Top women doctors lose out in NHS pay stakes
Senior NHS female doctors are earning less than their male counterparts, a BBC investigation shows.
Of the top 100 earning consultants in England, just five are women, despite more than a third of the workforce being female.
The top-paid man earned nearly £740,000 - two-and-a-half times that of the top woman. Overall, the gap between full-time men and women was 12% (£14,000).
But when overtime and bonuses were not included, average pay was £1,500 apart.
Some doctors the BBC spoke to said some of the difference was probably down to the fact men were more likely to do overtime.
But they said it was clear some of the gap was unfair with the system of bonuses and awards weighted in favour of men.
Senior female doctors described the findings as ""disappointing"" and said it showed more needs to be done to tackle the gender pay gap in medicine.
The figures were obtained by the BBC following requests to individual health trusts, the government and NHS Digital.
The top earning male consultant in England earned £739,460 in 2016-17
The best paid woman got £281,616 by comparison
On average, full-time men in England earned £127,683, nearly £14,000 more than full-time women
When you strip out overtime and bonuses and just look at basic pay there was nearly £1,500 difference
Six-and-a-half times as many men as women in England and Wales get the top platinum award bonus worth £77,000 a year
In Northern Ireland the gap between men and women's gross earnings was over £8,000
'Time to eliminate pay gap'
Dr Anthea Mowat, of the British Medical Association, said despite recent progress on gender pay, the figures obtained by the BBC showed there was ""clearly still a long way to go"".
She said women needed more support, including leadership training, mentoring and more flexible working opportunities.
""With women making up the majority of medical graduates in recent years, it's vitally important that we address the root causes of the gender pay gap, and develop a wider programme of work to eliminate it across the medical workforce,"" she added.
Dr Jacky Davis, a radiologist and former chair of the NHS Consultants Association, said she was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the figures.
""Some of it we can explain - men are more likely to do overtime for example - but that doesn't account for it all. In my experience men are better at pushing for more money, putting the case for awards and they get them.""
Dr Sally Davies, of the Medical Woman's Federation, agreed.
""We need to do more to support women. They often fall behind when they have children and have to take time off.
""By the time they get to the point where overtime is available or the awards are being handed out they find themselves behind men. It's a serious problem.""
Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said: ""This appears to be a long-term and serious problem within the medical workforce which the government, the profession and employers are committed to resolving.""
He said one of the causes was the consultants' contract - in the past it has been argued it allows high premiums to be charged for overtime and creates a bonus system that is skewed.
The government and BMA are currently in negotiations about the future of the contract.
The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We are committed to ensuring that our hardworking doctors are rewarded fairly and equally for their work — regardless of gender — and have commissioned an independent report alongside the medical profession to examine exactly how that can be achieved.""

"Let workers shed suits in hot weather, says trade union body
What to wear when it's beach weather in the office?
Only mad dogs and Englishmen wear suits to work in the kind of weather we've been having in the UK over the last few days.
On Tuesday in London temperatures are due to hit the mid-twenties again while rush hour is still in full swing.
It will be 25C by lunchtime in Manchester and Birmingham.
On cue, the TUC is calling on employers to relax their workplace dress codes to save us sweltering again in ties, jackets and long sleeves.
Many people already delight in the opportunity to switch to short sleeves, sandals, even shorts in very tolerant workplaces.
But more formal employers are still expecting staff to be buttoned up.
Should we be able to dress down for work during the heat wave?
Londoner Oliver Leigh, 23, says he is ""dripping"" by the time he arrives at work in his suit.
""I step off the tube looking like I've just got out of the shower.""
""I'd love to be able to dress down,"" he says, but he works in private healthcare and he's expected to dress formally.
There is more flexibility for women who can switch to sandals and short sleeves without breaching traditional dress codes.
But Ally Everett, 34, who works in advertising, and is in a sleeveless summer blouse, thinks there's room for more flexibility even for men.
""I think you can dress well without being in a suit,"" she says.
""Your professionalism comes across in your attitude not in what you're wearing.""
As long as you aren't showing too much skin, male or female, it should be fine to dress more casually, she says.
Oliver Leigh says he's ""dripping"" by the time he gets off the tube in a suit
TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady argues it's time for new policies in UK workplaces.

"Taylor Swift lyrics used on US road signs to stop people looking at phones
A lyric from Taylor Swift's new song is being used to try to stop people looking at their phones while driving.
Overhead signs in Iowa read: ""Old Taylor can't come to the phone right now... she's driving.""
On Look What You Made Me Do, Taylor Swift sings: ""I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now.. Why? 'Cos she's dead.""
Iowa Department of Transport has started using the adapted lyric as part of its ""zero fatalities"" campaign.
The state has a new theme every Monday and drivers are encouraged to send in their safety ideas for the state's 70 permanent overhead boards.
The messages are only 18 characters long and are over three lines, so have to be snappy to grab drivers' attention.
In 2016, 404 people were killed on Iowa's roads and officials are using the campaign to try to reduce that number.
Last year officials used the Pokemon Go craze to highlight road deaths.
And in 2015 Star Wars: The Force Awakens was used on overhead gantries.
The zero fatalities campaign in Iowa has been going since 2013.
The overhead signs usually carry information about road closures and traffic jams.

"PyeongChang Games end with spectacular closing ceremony -- and calls for peace
By Danielle Rossingh, for CNN
Updated 1425 GMT (2225 HKT) February 25, 2018
The Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics kicked off with a bang on February 9. It was the second Olympics to be held in Korea after Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games.
Whether a symbol of diplomacy or propaganda, North Korea's cheerleading squad made for mesmerizing viewing. The 230-strong troupe could be seen singing and clapping their country's athletes -- perfectly in sync.
A record number of 2,920 athletes from 92 countries participated in PyeongChang 2018. Team USA sent the largest number of Olympians, with 242 competing.
America's sweetheart Mikaela Shiffrin was set to be the standout star of the Games.
Austrian superstar Marcel Hirscher won his first Olympic gold in the alpine combined on day four. On day nine, he won his second, in the giant slalom. But the 28-year-old missed out on a third, after crashing in the men's slalom.
Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway became the oldest Olympic alpine skiing champion at the age of 35.
It was the last Olympics for American Lindsey Vonn, the most successful women's ski racer of all time.
She failed to complete her last Olympic race, after missing a gate in the slalom.
It was the Italian, Sofia Goggia -- who is currently leading the World Cup downhill standings -- that beat Vonn to gold. The 25-year-old became the first Italian to win gold in the women's downhill.
Canadian skating duo, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, won gold with their dazzling performance to songs from the ""Moulin Rouge"" soundtrack in the figure skating final. Their passion and chemistry sent the internet into meltdown, as fans couldn't believe their relationship was no more than a ""business"" one.
The tragic story of skater Elise Christie gripped the Brits. She was disqualified from the 1,000m heats following heavy crashes in both the 500m final and the semifinal of the 1,500m. History seems to repeat itself -- Christie was also disqualified from all three events at Sochi 2014.
Japan was enthralled by Yuzuru Hanyu, who became the first male figure skater since 1952 to win back-to-back skating golds. At the end of his routine, fans showered the rink with Winnie the Pooh toys, Hanyu's lucky charm.
US teenage Chloe Kim made history, becoming the youngest female Winter Olympic gold medalist. The 17-year-old got a near-perfect score of 98.25 in the women's halfpipe.
America's Gus Kenworthy made the headlines not for his snowboarding prowess, but for kissing his boyfriend, Mathew Wakes, live on TV. The moment was hailed as a celebration of LGBTQ pride.
In a big upset for curling's three-time defending gold medalist Canada, Team USA beat them 5-3 in the semifinals. This takes them to the gold medal match against Sweden, for the first time in US curling history.
Following Russia's doping scandal, the country was banned from the Winter Olympics, with 169 of their athletes allowed to compete as neutrals. But, in a shocking turn of events, two of Team OAR's curlers -- husband and wife -- were stripped of their bronze medals after one of them, Aleksandr Krushelnitckii, tested positive for the banned substance meldonium.
Wojtek Wolski turned heads, playing on Canada's Olympic ice hockey team, just 16 months after breaking his neck.
Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson scored the winning goal in a penalty shootout to give the United States a 3-2 victory against Canada, the four-time defending Olympic champion.
Jessica Diggins pipped her Swedish rival to claim the Olympic title in the cross country team sprint final on day 12. Along with her teammate Kikkan Randall, they will be the first American women ever to win gold medals in cross country skiing.
Pita Taufatofua competed in Taekwondo at the summer games Rio 2016. This wasn't enough for the Tongan flag-bearer, and he decided to take on the winter ones too, competing in the 15-kilometer cross country skiing event. He crossed the line in 114th position.
The Jamaican women bobsled team made their Olympic debut at PyeongChang, 30 years after the men's team captured hearts around the world, inspiring the movie, ""Cool Runnings.""
Fans look on at the luge women's singles on day four of the games. 1,045,727 tickets were sold to spectators throughout the games.
""The time of peace will continue,"" Korean president Moon Jae-in tells crowd
Closing ceremony attended by 35,000 people, including Ivanka Trump
Norway tops medals table with winter Olympic record 39 medals
The PyeongChang Olympics have ended with a spectacular closing ceremony that once again saw athletes from North and South Korea marching together.
Preceded by months of mounting tension between North and South Korea and the US, the Games ended with a softening of relations between the two Korean countries, who competed under a united flag.
""The Olympic Winter Games at Pyeongchang has come to an end, but the time of peace will continue,"" Korean president Moon Jae-in said in closing remarks distributed by the organizing committee ahead of the closing ceremony.
The showpiece attracted a crowd of 35,000 spectators, including dignitaries such as US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka, to the Pyeongchang Olympic stadium.

Let us know your favorite moments of the Winter Olympics on our Facebook page
Both Korean countries competed as one team in the women's hockey and marched under a unified flag at the opening and closing ceremonies.
North Korea also sent cheerleaders and musicians to the Games, while Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, attended the opening ceremony and met with Moon.
The closing ceremony started with the Olympic Stadium aglow with lights, and the crowd counting down together to say ""one,"" when performers representing the athletes entered the stadium.
It also featured traditional and contemporary Korean dance, music, puppets, a giant turtle -- a sacred animal in Korea -- and finished with a thumping dance party for the athletes.
""This celebration of peace that began at Pyeongchang will continue on to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Summer Games and the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games,"" said Moon.
""Here in Korea, we will continue our endeavor to broaden the horizon of peace that began in Pyeonchang.""
The unified Korean team enter the stadium.
IOC calls Pyeongchang ""a success""
Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), told the crowd: ""The Olympic Games of PyeongChang 2018 are the games of new horizons.""
He thanked the athletes for their ""competitive spirit and fair play"" and told the PyeongChang organizing committee: ""Thank you from the bottom of my heart.""
Addressing Korean President Moon, Bach said: ""Thank you for your personal commitment and determination to make these Games so successful in every way.""
In remarks distributed by organizers before the closing ceremony, Bach had said: ""We have seen here how sport can make the world a better place.
""The way in which the DPRK athletes have been received by their fellow athletes and by the crowds shows the Olympic spirit in action.""
Bach ended his speech by bringing athletes from the five continents on to the stage, which included Lindsey Vonn of the US, the world's most successful female ski racer of all time, and Tongan flag bearer Pita Taufatofua.

The 23rd Winter Olympics, the first in South Korea since the 1988 Seoul Summer Games, passed by without any major scandals or organizational hiccups, though there were some sporadic cases of doping.
Earlier Sunday there was controversy after the Olympic Athlete from Russia (OAR) team beat Germany to win the men's ice hockey gold and then sang the Russian national anthem while the Olympic song was being played at the medal ceremony against IOC stipulations.
The IOC had banned Russia from competing in the Winter Games because of state-sponsored doping before and during the 2014 Sochi Olympics.
Instead, the IOC allowed 168 Russian athletes to compete as the Olympic Athlete from Russia (OAR) team under a neutral flag, provided they could prove there were clean.
Although two Russian athletes on the OAR team tested positive for banned substances during the Games, the IOC on Sunday ruled it will lift the country's Olympic ban, provided there aren't any more doping cases from its athletes in Pyeongchang.
However, the IOC did not allow the OAR team to march under the Russian flag in the closing ceremony.
In the first week of the Games, the weather took center stage as high winds wreaked havoc with the schedule, ending the multiple gold medal hopes of US ski star Mikaela Shiffrin, who leaves Pyeongchang with one gold and one silver.
Mikaela Shiffrin reflects on Winter Olympics
Mikaela Shiffrin reflects on Winter Olympics
Over 3,000 athletes from 92 countries had competed for 102 gold medals, helped by some 20,000 volunteers.
Women provided the breakout performances of the Games, with an unknown Czech athlete, Ester Ledecka, taking center stage as she became the first person to triumph in two different sports at a Winter Olympics when she followed up her shock win in the super-G alpine skiing with gold in the snowboarding parallel slalom.
Although the 22-year-old Ledecka was the fifth athlete to win in two sports at one Games, she was the first to do it in two completely different events as the previous double wins had been achieved in Nordic ski competitions.
Ledecka is a once-in-a-generation talent
Bjoergen bows out as greatest of all time
The last event of the Olympics, the women's cross-country 30-kilometer mass start (classic) was won, perhaps fittingly, by Marit Bjoergen, who ended her Olympic career as the greatest winter Olympian of all time.
Waving the Norwegian flag and with a beaming smile on her face as she crossed the finish line in one hour, 22 minutes and 17.6 seconds, the 37-year-old mother-of-one clinched a record eighth gold medal.
A few hours later, Bjoergen received her gold medal during the closing ceremony in the stadium from IOC president Bach.
Norway's Marit Bjoergen celebrates after winning the women's 30km cross-country mass start.
It was her fifth medal at the Pyeongchang Games, and her 15th overall. It was also the 39th medal for Norway, a winter Olympic record. Germany was second on the medals table with 31 medals while Canada finished third with 29.
The US sent its biggest ever team but finished in a disappointing fourth place on the medals table with 23 medals, which was well below its target of 37 and its worst performance in 20 years. Great Britain won five medals, its most ever at a Winter Games.
The host nation ended the games in seventh place with 17 medals.
Norway's gold medallists Ingvild Flugstad Oestberg, Astrid Uhrenholdt Jacobsen, Ragnhild Haga and Marit Bjeorgen pose on the podium during the medal ceremony for the cross country women's 4x5km relay.
The first part of the closing ceremony featured a young guitarist playing from the highest spot in the stadium, and a solo dancer performing Korea's traditional Spring Dance of Nightingale on the ground stage with the sound of geomungo, a traditional Korean string instrument, resonating through the stadium.
Flagbearers arrive during the closing ceremony.
The crowd let out a huge roar when the athletes, many waving flags and dancing with each other, entered the stadium to a live band playing Korean music.
But the biggest cheer was reserved for the unified North and Korean team, who entered the arena together for the second time in 17 days.
The Pyeongchang Games officially ended with the traditional raising of the Greek flag, the lowering of the Olympic flag and the Beijing 2022 flag handover ceremony before the Olympic flame was extinguished.

"The great intellectual property trade-off
BBC World Service, 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy
In January 1842, Charles Dickens arrived on American shores for the first time.
He was greeted like a rock star in Boston, Massachusetts, but the great novelist was a man with a cause: he wanted to put an end to cheap, sloppy pirated copies of his work in the US.
They circulated with impunity because the United States granted no copyright protection to non-citizens.
In a bitter letter to a friend, Dickens compared the situation to being mugged and then paraded through the streets in ridiculous clothes.
""Is it tolerable that besides being robbed and rifled,"" he wrote, ""an author should be forced to appear in any form - in any vulgar dress - in any atrocious company?""
It was a powerful and melodramatic metaphor. But the truth is the case for what Dickens was demanding - legal protection for ideas that otherwise could be freely copied and adapted - has never been quite so clear cut.
highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.
It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find
Patents and copyright grant a monopoly.
Dickens's British publishers will have charged as much as they could get away with for copies of Bleak House. Cash-strapped literature lovers simply had to go without.
But these potential fat profits encourage new ideas.
Many US editions of Dickens's work - including Bleak House - were pirated copies
It took Dickens a long time to write Bleak House. If other British publishers could have ripped it off like the Americans, perhaps he wouldn't have bothered.
So, intellectual property reflects an economic trade-off, a balancing act. If it's too generous to the creators, then good ideas will take too long to copy, adapt and spread. If it's too stingy, then maybe we won't see the good ideas at all.
This trade-off has always been coloured by politics.
The British legal system strongly protected the rights of British authors and British inventors in the 1800s because the UK was then - as now - a powerful force in world culture and innovation.
But in Dickens's day, American literature and innovation were in their infancy. The US economy was in full-blown copying mode: they wanted the cheapest possible access to the best ideas that Europe could offer.
US newspapers filled their pages with brazen copying - alongside attacks on the interfering Mr Dickens.
A few decades later, when American authors and inventors spoke with a more powerful voice, America's lawmakers began to take an increasingly fond view of the idea of intellectual property. Newspapers, once opposed to copyright, now rely upon it.
And we can expect to see a similar transition in developing countries today: the less they copy other ideas and the more they create their own, the more they protect ideas. There's been a lot of recent movement: China didn't have a copyright system at all until 1991.
The modern form of intellectual property originated, like so many things, in 15th Century Venice. Venetian patents were explicitly designed to encourage innovation.
Francesco Foscari was Doge of Venice in 1474 when the Venetian patent statute was introduced
The inventor would automatically receive a patent if their invention was useful. The patent was temporary, but could be sold, transferred or even inherited during its lifetime.
It would be forfeited if it wasn't used, and invalidated if the invention proved to be closely based on a previous idea.
These are all very modern ideas. And they soon created very modern problems.
During the British industrial revolution, the great engineer James Watt worked out a superior way to design a steam engine. He spent months developing a prototype, but then put even more effort into securing a patent.
His influential business partner, Matthew Boulton, even got the patent extended by lobbying Parliament.
Boulton and Watt used it to extract licensing fees and crush rivals - for example, Jonathan Hornblower, who made an even better steam engine yet found himself ruined and imprisoned.
Boulton and Watt put a huge amount of effort into protecting their invention
The details may have been grubby, but surely Watt's famous invention was worth it? Well, maybe not.
The economists Michele Boldrin and David Levine argue that what truly unleashed steam-powered industry was the expiry of the patent, in 1800, as rival inventors revealed the ideas they had been sitting on for years.
And what happened to Boulton and Watt, once they could no longer sue those rivals? They flourished anyway. They redirected their attention from litigation towards the challenge of producing the best steam engines in the world. They kept their prices as high as ever, and their order books swelled.
Far from incentivising improvements in the steam engine, the patent actually delayed them.
Yet since the days of Boulton and Watt, intellectual property protection has grown more expansive, not less so.
Copyright terms are growing ever longer. In the US, they were originally 14 years, renewable once. They now last 70 years after the death of the author - typically more than a century.
Patents have become broader and are being granted on vague ideas - for example, Amazon's ""one-click"" US patent protects the not-entirely-radical idea of buying a product on the internet by clicking only one button.
Amazon's ""one-click"" buying process is now protected
The US intellectual property system now has a global reach, thanks to the inclusion of intellectual property rules in what tend to be described as ""trade agreements"".
And more and more things fall under the scope of intellectual property - for example plants, buildings and software have all been brought into its domain.
These expansions are hard to justify, but easy to explain: intellectual property is very valuable to its owners, which justifies the cost of employing expensive lawyers and lobbyists.
Meanwhile, the cost of the restrictions are spread widely among people who barely notice it.
The likes of Matthew Boulton and Charles Dickens have a strong incentive to lobby aggressively for more draconian intellectual property laws - while the many buyers of steam engines and Bleak House are unlikely to get politically organised to object.
The economists Boldrin and Levine have
There are, after all, other rewards for inventing things - getting a ""first mover"" advantage over your competitors, establishing a strong brand, or enjoying a deeper understanding of what makes a product work.
In 2014, the electric car company Tesla opened up access to its patent archive in an effort to expand the industry as a whole, calculating the company would benefit overall.
Tesla's Model S was the world's best-selling plug-in electric car for two years in a row, 2015 and 2016
For most economists, scrapping intellectual property entirely is going too far. They point to important cases - such as new medicines - where the costs of invention are enormous and the costs of copying are trivial.
But those who defend intellectual property protections still tend to argue that - right now - those protections offer more than enough incentive to create new ideas.
Dickens himself eventually discovered a financial upside to weak copyright protection.
Twenty five years after his initial visit to the US, Dickens returned, keen to make some money.
He reckoned that so many people had read cheap knock-offs of his stories that he could cash in on his fame with a lecture tour. He was absolutely right: off the back of pirated copies of his work, Charles Dickens made a fortune as a public speaker, many millions of dollars in today's terms.
Perhaps the intellectual property was worth more when given away.

"Weinstein Company to file for bankruptcy
Harvey Weinstein is facing dozens of accusations of abuse
The New York studio co-founded by disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein is to file for bankruptcy after talks to sell its assets to an investor group collapsed, reports say.
Talks ended two weeks ago when
against the Weinstein Company.
Directors were quoted as saying bankruptcy was the only viable option.
Mr Weinstein faces dozens of allegations of sexual abuse, including rape, but denies non-consensual sex.
""The Weinstein Company has been engaged in an active sale process in the hopes of preserving assets and jobs,"" the board said in a statement reported by several US newspapers.
""Today, those discussions concluded without a signed agreement.""
The statement said ""an orderly bankruptcy process"" was the ""only viable option to maximise the company's remaining value"".
The civil rights lawsuit against the company alleges that Mr Weinstein sexually harassed and abused women employed by the studio for years, as well as making verbal threats to kill staff members.
It accuses senior executives at the company, including Mr Weinstein's brother Robert, of failing to prevent the mistreatment of staff despite being presented with evidence.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is seeking an unspecified sum to cover damages, plus penalties, for victims of alleged abuse.
A lawyer for Mr Weinstein has said a ""fair investigation"" will show that many of the allegations are without merit, while the company's board of directors has said many of the allegations relating to the board are ""inaccurate"".
The Weinstein Company: Biggest US box-office gross successes
The Weinstein Company is based in New York
Django Unchained (2012) ($162.8m)
The King's Speech (2010) ($138.8m)
Silver Linings Playbook (2012) ($132.1m)
Inglourious Basterds (2009) ($120.5m)
The Butler (2013) ($116.6m)
The allegations against Mr Weinstein first surfaced in October last year, when the New York Times published a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Mr Weinstein.
Since then, more than 50 women, among them some of the biggest names in Hollywood, have accused the film producer of sexual assault, harassment, abuse and rape.
In the wake of the allegations, Mr Weinstein was sacked by the board of his company.
He is under investigation by UK and US police, but no criminal charges have been brought.
Mr Weinstein, who was once among the most powerful men in Hollywood, has admitted that his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"" but has described many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"".

Stelter: Fox's pro-Trump hosts are working overtime to discredit Robert Mueller
December 7, 2017: 6:36 PM ET
This is why Trump loves 'Fox & Friends'
What's President Trump hearing when he watches Fox News?
He's hearing that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is ""illegitimate and corrupt."" That it's led by a ""band of merry Trump-haters"" who are trying to reverse the results of the election. And that it must be stopped.
He's also hearing that the FBI is becoming ""America's secret police,"" akin to the KGB in Russia, full of ""sickness"" and ""corruption.""
These are all actual quotes from some of the president's favorite pro-Trump talk shows.
The overarching message from ""Fox & Friends"" and ""Hannity"" is unmistakable: Mr. President, you're the victim of a ""deep state"" plot to take you down. Don't let it happen.
Sean Hannity, the highest-rated host on Fox, has renewed his calls for Mueller to resign. And Fox's other pro-Trump shows reinforce this message on a daily basis.
In recent weeks, there's been a big increase in reporting about Mueller's probe and how it could affect Trump's inner circle. At the same time, there's also been a sharp escalation in the anti-Mueller rhetoric coming from right wing media sources.
With four of Trump's associates now charged by Mueller's team, and congressional probes also proceeding in many different directions, other channels are filled with the latest twists and turns about the intensifying investigations.
But viewers who stick to Fox might not know that. The nightly focus is on Mueller's alleged partisanship, not Trump's potential problems.
Last weekend, The New York Times and The Washington Post reported that Mueller had removed FBI official Peter Strzok from his team of investigators due to text messages from Strzok that could be interpreted as anti-Trump. Even though Strzok was reassigned to FBI human resources, the story is the centerpiece of the current anti-Mueller hits.
Newt Gingrich, who praised Mueller's appointment back in May, now sounds like a different person altogether.
""Mueller is corrupt. The senior FBI is corrupt. The system is corrupt,"" he told Laura Ingraham on Wednesday night.
One hour earlier, the banners on Sean Hannity's show read ""MUELLER'S PARTISAN ATTACK TEAM"" and ""THE DEEP STATE,"" so even if viewers had the volume down, they still saw the message. Channel surfers who stumbled on Fox by mistake might think they had landed in an alternate universe.
Hannity began the hour by slamming ""Robert Mueller's partisan, extremely biased, hyper-partisan attack team,"" calling the accomplished lawyers ""an utter disgrace.""
He invoked the U.S. Constitution and said ""they now pose a direct threat to you, the American people, and our American republic."" Repeating something he has said dozens of times before, Hannity said, ""this entire witch-hunt needs to be shut down -- and shut down immediately.""
Then Hannity brought in news anchor turned ""legal analyst"" Gregg Jarrett, who appears on the program almost every night to savage Mueller and company.
""I think we now know that the Mueller investigation is illegitimate and corrupt,"" Jarrett said. ""And Mueller has been using the FBI as a political weapon. And the FBI has become America's secret police. Secret surveillance, wiretapping, intimidation, harassment and threats. It's like the old KGB that comes for you in the dark of the night banging through your door.""
""This is not hyperbole you are using here,"" Hannity said, credulously.
""No. Ask Paul Manafort, they came for him and broke through his front door,"" Jarrett said.
Jarrett and Hannity commented that if it can happen to Manafort, it can happen to anyone.
Manafort and co-defendant Rick Gates have been charged with conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money and unregistered agent of a foreign principal. They have pleaded not guilty.
The repetition is really something to behold -- not just by hosts but by guests who back up the anti-Mueller arguments. ""There needs to be an investigation of the investigation,"" Mike Huckabee, father of White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, said on ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday.
The next night, on Fox Business, fervertly pro-Trump host Lou Dobbs tried to outdo his colleagues. He said Strzok, Mueller and former FBI director James Comey ""should be the subjects of criminal investigations and held fully accountable for crimes against a sitting president and the voters who supported him.""
Dobbs added, ""Just one man's opinion.""
Later that evening, Hannity's opinion was that Mueller is the ""head of the snake."" He called the special counsel a ""disgrace to the American justice system"" and asserted that the country is ""now on the brink of becoming a banana republic.""
Fox News is arguably the most powerful conservative media megaphone, but it is far from the only outlet questioning the credibility of Mueller, a registered Republican who is widely respected by legal experts.
The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post -- outlets that are, like Fox, owned by Rupert Murdoch -- have also repeatedly published opinion pieces with sharp criticism of Mueller.
Breitbart stories refer to Mueller as ""embattled."" And radio host Rush Limbaugh recently claimed Mueller is leading a ""silent coup"" to remove Trump.
Back on Fox, Hannity pairs his Mueller attacks with claims that Hillary Clinton has received special kid-gloves treatment from the FBI.
While Hannity's intent is rather transparent -- he's running interference for his friend the president -- his assertions are heard by several million viewers every night, some of whom work at the White House.
Imagine how the president might react to hearing this rhetoric over and over again: ""Mueller's stooges literally are doing everything within their power, and then some, to try and remove President Trump from office.""
That's another example from Wednesday night's ""Hannity."" There are numerous examples of anti-Mueller messages every single day.

"Patrick O'Flynn quits UKIP front bench over party's direction
Patrick O'Flynn was a political journalist on the Daily Express
A leading member of UKIP has resigned from the party's front bench for the second time, saying he is worried about the direction the party is taking.
Patrick O'Flynn, who is standing down as economics spokesman, claims the ""centrist approach"" advocated by him and others ""is falling by the wayside"".
The ex-journalist made the announcement as nominations are set to close in the contest to replace leader Paul Nuttall.
Mr Nuttall quit after UKIP failed to win any seats in the general election.
Mr O'Flynn also resigned as economics spokesman in 2015 after he described former UKIP leader Nigel Farage as ""snarling, thin-skinned and aggressive"" - remarks for which he later apologised.
Announcing his most recent departure, he said: ""I have always argued for UKIP to be at the commonsense centre of politics, rather than defined as on the right-wing.
""It is clear to me that UKIP's activist base wishes to go in a more libertarian, shrink-the-state and Thatcherite direction.
""It is regrettable that the more centrist approach argued by the likes of me and Suzanne Evans is falling by the wayside.""
Mr O'Flynn, who will continue to serve as an MEP, said he was proud of the role he played in bringing about Brexit.
His decision to step down comes a day before the 28 July deadline for leadership nominations.
UKIP MEP Bill Etheridge withdrew his leadership bid on Wednesday, with a call for ""libertarian"" candidates to unite against hard-liners using the party ""as a vehicle for the views of the EDL and the BNP"".
He also called on Mr Farage to make clear which leadership candidate had his support.
Figures who have declared their intention to run include: Scottish leader David Coburn, MEP Jane Collins, London Assembly members Peter Whittle and David Kurten, Sharia Watch director Ann Marie Waters, former UKIP councillor Ben Walker, former Kent police and crime commissioner candidate Henry Bolton and direct democracy activist John Rees-Evans, who came third in the last contest.
The full line-up in the race to succeed Mr Nuttall is not expected to be announced until several days after nominations close.
Candidates must be vetted by UKIP's National Executive Committee before securing a place on the ballot paper.
The new leader will be announced at UKIP's conference in Torquay on 29 September.

"Emmys 2017: Reese Witherspoon hails ‘incredible year’ for women on TV
Entertainment & arts reporter
Kidman and Witherspoon said they created Big Little Lies ""out of frustration""
One of the reasons this year's Emmys stood out was for its celebration of strong female characters and actors.
Big Little Lies and The Handmaid's Tale - two dramas led by exceptional actresses - got five Emmys apiece.
Reese Witherspoon, who produced and starred in Big Little Lies with Nicole Kidman, said: ""It's been an incredible year for women on television.""
Kidman, who won an acting award for her work on the show, added: ""So now, more roles for women, please!""
Big Little Lies featured an all-star cast that also included Laura Dern, who was named best supporting actress in a limited series.
Shailene Woodley and Zoe Kravitz also appeared in the mini-series, which ran on Sky Atlantic in the UK.
Ann Dowd, Elisabeth Moss and Alexis Bledel starred in The Handmaid's Tale
Accepting the best limited series award, Witherspoon called on TV executives to ""bring women to the front of their own stories and make them the hero of their own stories"".
She added: ""Thank you for that opportunity and for audiences to wrap their arms around us.""
Kidman referred to her friendship with Witherspoon, telling the audience: ""This is a friendship that then created opportunities. It created opportunities out of our frustration because we weren't getting offered great roles.""
Like Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale won five awards in total.
Reed Morano won best directing in a drama series for The Handmaid's Tale
Elisabeth Moss, who won best actress in a drama series for playing sex slave Offred in The Handmaid's Tale, said it was important for stories to be led by and made by women.
She said: ""It's my bread and butter, it's what I'm most interested in as a woman, shows that are about women.
""It's what I like to watch. And it's apparently quite obvious that it's what the audiences like to see.""
Moss also said there's ""still a lot of work to be done"", adding: ""There are still meetings you walk into and you wonder if they say 'no' because it's a show or film led by a woman.""
The production made an effort to have women behind as well as in front of the camera, she added - with one of the show's awards going to Reed Morano for outstanding directing in a drama series.
Morano's work on the series
to direct The Rhythm Section, a thriller starring Gossip Girl's Blake Lively.

"Las Vegas shooting: Country music stars react
Country star Jason Aldean says the Las Vegas shooting is ""beyond horrific"".
He was performing at the Route 91 Harvest festival when a gunman opened fire,
Videos posted online show the musician and his band stop playing as shots are heard and people begin screaming.
It happened at the end of the three-day festival, which featured some of the biggest names in country music, including Eric Church, Sam Hunt and Marin Morris.
Following the shooting, Jason Aldean posted an emotional message on Instagram.
The star, who's sold 15 million albums and had 17 number one songs, said: ""Tonight has been beyond horrific. I still don't know what to say but wanted to let everyone know that me and my crew are safe.""
He goes on to say that it ""hurts my heart"" that people have been injured when they'd just gone to enjoy themselves.
The Route 91 Harvest festival was launched in 2014.
In previous years it's had around 30,000 people watching each day. This year organisers promised a #ThreeDayNeonSleepover.
Jake Owen was on stage just before Jason Aldean. He posted messages while the shooting was going on.
Hours later he tweeted to say he was OK.
Although they may not be huge names in the UK, country stars have massive followings in America - with both young and old audiences.

"Shell's gender pay audit reveals women paid 22% less than men
Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell says male staff working for the company on average earn 22% more than women.
Shell says that despite this, it is confident it pays equally for equal work, and the difference in pay rates is because of a skills gap, rather than sex discrimination.
The company is the latest to report its gender pay gap.
The government now requires bodies with more than 250 employees to publish gender pay gap figures every year.
The data will eventually be available on a
in an attempt to tackle workplace discrimination.
Shell UK's chairman, Sinead Lynch, said: ""Through our robust and non-discriminatory pay processes, we are confident we have equal pay, however, we do have a gender pay gap.
""For Shell UK, there are two main reasons for the gender pay gap: fewer women in senior leadership positions, and fewer women working in technical or trading roles that attract higher levels of pay.""

"Brexit: Gove confirms foreign access to UK fishing grounds
Scottish fishermen are largely supportive of Brexit
Michael Gove has confirmed that some foreign trawlers will still have access to UK waters after Brexit.
Mr Gove, the UK environment secretary, said British fishermen would not have the capacity to land all of the fish in British territorial waters.
And he said that some access would therefore be granted to vessels from other countries.
He was speaking during a fact-finding mission to Denmark, which was largely focused on the Danish food industry.
The Danish fishing industry is currently highly-dependent on fish caught in UK territorial waters.
The meeting was attended by Niels Wichmann, chief executive of the Danish Fishermen organisation, who told BBC Scotland that there was no suggestion from Mr Gove that Denmark would receive preferential treatment.
And he said Mr Gove ""did not say numerous countries, he just said other countries"" would be granted access.
Mr Wichmann added: ""The thing is he was just being realistic and he was saying that we need, within the Brexit negotiations phase, to find out where the final goal is, the final solution to the fisheries.
""The fisheries will be outside the common fisheries policy and we need a transitional period. In that transitional period we will have to have access from other countries.""
Mr Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr last month that no foreign fishing would be allowed within six to 12 miles of the UK coast after Brexit
Mr Wichmann also said that the Danes were seeking a deal that would effectively mean ""business as usual"" with regard to access to UK fisheries after Brexit.
Mr Gove's remarks in Denmark follow an
, when he said no foreign boats would be allowed to fish within six to 12 miles of the UK coast.
But he said the UK would become an ""independent coastal state"" after leaving the EU, which would allow it to extend control of its waters up to 200 miles from its coastline.
Mr Gove said this would allow the UK to ""take control"" of its waters, and then negotiate with other countries to allow them access to British fisheries.
He also described the EU's common fisheries policy as an environmental disaster, and said the government wanted to change that, upon Brexit, to ensure sustainable fish stocks in future.
The common fisheries policy has been extremely unpopular among Scottish fishermen, who are said to have overwhelmingly backed Brexit.
Anger has generally been focused on quotas for fishing catches and on other European fleets being given equal access to fishing grounds in Scottish waters.
Responding to Mr Gove's remarks, Bertie Armstrong of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said: ""It is clear from our meetings with the government that control over our waters will be in our hands after Brexit.
""We will be out of the Common Fisheries Policy and we will decide who fishes where and for what. Our position is straightforward: we must have first call on quota.""
But the SNP claimed that the ""startling revelations on the Tories' true position over fisheries post-Brexit"" showed that ""you cannot trust the Tories to stand up for rural Scotland's interests"".
SNP MSP Stewart Stevenson said: ""Michael Gove must immediately make absolutely clear what the UK government's real position on the future of fisheries is.
""He could start by confirming that devolved powers over fisheries will transfer to Scotland so that we can get on with developing our own management policies which put Scottish fishing interests, offshore and onshore, first.""
A spokesman for the UK's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""Leaving the EU means we will take back control of our territorial waters, and for the first time in 50 years we will be able to grant fishing access for other countries on our terms.
""We will allocate quotas on the basis of what is scientifically sustainable, making sure we have a healthy marine environment and profitable fishing industry.""

"San Francisco to restrict goods delivery robots
The Marble robot is being tested in San Francisco but currently has a member of staff walking behind it
San Francisco officials have voted to restrict where delivery robots can go in the city, in a blow for the burgeoning industry.
Start-ups will have to get permits to use such bots, which will be restricted to less crowded urban areas.
Opponents are concerned about the safety of pedestrians, particularly elderly people and children.
Walk San Francisco, a group that campaigns for pedestrian safety, wanted a complete ban.
A range of companies have begun trialling small robots that can deliver food and other goods.
They use sensors and lasers in a similar way to self-driving cars in order to navigate their routes.
Robotics company Marble - which describes its machines as ""friendly, neighbourhood robots"" - began testing in San Francisco earlier this year.
Other companies, such as Starship and Postmates, are also keen to use pavements for robot deliveries.
San Francisco supervisor Norman Yee, who originally proposed a ban on such robots, has previously said that the city's streets ""are for people, not robots"".
Despite its proximity to Silicon Valley, San Francisco is falling behind other states such as Virginia and Idaho where there are already laws permitting delivery robots to operate.
The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce lobbied against an all-out ban of such robots, saying that ""could create a massive barrier to future innovation in the industry"".
In October the legislation was reframed to look at regulation rather than a ban.

"Anger at Labour conference Brexit vote
There have been pro-EU protests outside the party conference
Pro-EU Labour MPs have expressed their anger after no Brexit motions were chosen to be voted on at party conference.
Instead, delegates chose Grenfell Tower, rail, growth and investment, public sector pay, workers' rights, the NHS, housing and social care.
Party sources said there would still be a debate and vote on the subject.
But there will be no vote on contentious issues like single market membership.
The Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Momentum group had urged its members not to support a conference motion on Brexit, emailing members with an alternative list of subjects.
After the eight subjects chosen by local members and trade union members were announced, several Labour MPs tweeted their displeasure.
Former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said the outcome was ""utterly ridiculous"" and former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw tweeted: ""Keeping #Brexit, biggest issue of our time, off our #lab17 agenda is silly and undermines the claim that we are listening to our members.""
Chuka Umunna, of the pro-EU Open Britain campaign, tweeted: ""I can't believe no Brexit related motion is being debated at #Lab17 tomorrow. We should not be ducking this debate - we should be leading it.""
Labour said choosing which issues to prioritise for debate was the choice of delegates.
""Brexit will be debated by conference in a session set aside for Brexit and international issues on Monday morning,"" the party added.
However, this will focus on approving existing policy, with none of the separate resolutions put forward by delegates on Brexit selected.
One source told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg it was a ""swindle"" to suggest Brexit would be properly debated and discussed at the conference.
Liberal Democrat shadow Brexit secretary Tom Brake said: ""Corbyn's anti-EU wing of the Labour party have won the day.
""Labour have again shown themselves to be neither here nor there, unable to come up with a coherent policy for fear of their own internal politics spilling out into the public.""
On Sunday, Mr Corbyn faced calls to commit Labour to stay in the EU single market and customs union after Brexit, but he warned this could affect the UK government's ability to use state aid to safeguard jobs.

"Medical school places to increase next year
An extra 500 extra medical school places in England have been confirmed for next year by the government.
The Department of Health announced in October it planned to add up to 1,500 more places each year - a boost of 25% on current student doctor numbers - and says it will hit that target by 2020.
It is part of a plan to use UK-trained doctors to ease NHS staffing pressures.
But the British Medical Association says the plan will not address the immediate shortage of medics.
Training to become a doctor takes at least five years and currently about 6,000 graduate each year.
The government wants many of the new training places to go to students from disadvantaged backgrounds to improve diversity in the medical profession.
Medical schools will be able to bid to run some of the extra course places.
Those that can demonstrate they are targeting under-represented social groups, such as poorer students, will be favoured, as will those covering regions that struggle to attract trainee medics - rural areas and costal towns, for example.
The extra training places in England will ultimately mean 7,500 home-grown doctors should graduate each year.
Currently, about a quarter of doctors working in the NHS trained outside the UK.
There are concerns that the impact of Brexit and a global shortage of doctors could make it harder to recruit as many in the future.
Some UK-trained medics are also leaving the country to work elsewhere.
Harrison Carter from the BMA said: ""The students who will benefit from these new placements will take at least 10 years to train and become senior doctors so we mustn't forget this promise won't tackle the immediate shortage of doctors in the NHS which could become more acute following Brexit.
""As such, we require equal focus on retaining existing doctors in high-quality jobs which will provide more immediate relief to an overstretched medical workforce.""
Health Minister Philip Dunne said: ""We're committed to giving more talented students the chance to be part of our world-class NHS workforce.
""Not only is this the biggest ever expansion to the number of doctor training places, but it's also one of the most inclusive; ensuring everyone has the chance to study medicine regardless of their background, and ensuring the NHS is equipped for the future with doctors serving in the areas that need them the most.""
Prof Wendy Reid, from Health Education England, said the extra places would help the NHS meet the diverse healthcare needs of patients ""up and down the country"".
Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Ministers have repeatedly announced plans to increase doctors' training levels and in many key medical specialities they are failing to fill the places already on offer.
""The government need to get a grip and put in place a long-term workforce plan backed up with significant new investment for the number of staff needed to deliver services safely.""

'Black Panther' is outselling every previous superhero film in advance ticket sales
February 2, 2018: 9:39 AM ET
The Marvel model for success
from hitting theaters but advanced ticket sales on Fandango is already outpacing all other superhero films.
Following a star-studded
, ticket sales for the Marvel Studios production, which stars Chadwick Boseman and Lupita Nyong'o, has also eclipsed every other movie that currently has tickets for sale on Fandango.
The impressive pace of ticket sales is a measurement of enthusiasm for a highly-anticipated film that was years in the making. Whether ""Black Panther"" will break more records on opening day and in the weeks following remains to be seen. The movie opens on February 16.
The film has already amassed rave reviews from fans on social media following Monday's world premiere. Box office success would simply reinforce the superhero genre as one of the most bankable in Hollywood. When tickets went on sale earlier this month, ""Black Panther""
for Marvel Cinematic Universe films in its first 24 hours, a record previously held by 2016's ""Captain America: Civil War.""
Of the top ten biggest opening weekends of all time, five are superhero films. At the top is 2012's ""The Avengers"" at $207 million, making it the fourth biggest opening of all time behind the last two ""Star Wars"" films and ""Jurassic World.""
Industry analysts are projecting that ""Black Panther"" could open at around $130 million or higher, but they caution that it's still too early to tell.
""'Black Panther' is generating the kind of buzz that is usually reserved for the summer movie season,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at
""Black Panther"" is also breaking grounds in the superhero genre.
Comic book films like 1998's ""Blade"" have starred African American superheroes, but ""Black Panther"" is
(Ryan Coogler) and one of the first major superhero films that has a predominantly African-American cast.
Related: 'Black Panther' to have first black Marvel director with Ryan Coogler
Those points have seemingly made the film more alluring to audiences, according to a poll held by Fandango.
A survey of more than 1,000 ""Black Panther"" online ticket-buyers, the ticket seller found that 97% are looking forward to ""a different kind of superhero movie.""
""This is more than a movie,"" Dergarabedian said. ""It's a cultural event that is a milestone on so many levels and as such will generate one of the biggest February debuts of all-time.""

"Calls to cancel Katie Hopkins' appearance at Lewes Speakers Festival
Katie Hopkins said she is prepared for hecklers at the festival
Calls have been made to cancel an appearance by controversial columnist Katie Hopkins at a literary festival.
Lewes Speakers Festival manager Marc Rattray said he would not cancel Ms Hopkins' talk in Sussex unless he was ""forced"" to.
""People have gone to the council, tried to have her banned under the rules of the venue, and I've had a lot of emails suggesting I withdraw her,"" he said.
Ms Hopkins said: ""It's ok not to agree, but please don't attack the organiser.""
A thread about Ms Hopkins attending the November festival was started on the

Speaking to BBC Sussex earlier, Mr Rattray said: ""I am under a lot of pressure to cancel [Ms Hopkins] and that would be really regrettable.
""We live in a democracy in this county and free speech is a virtue. If people disagree with what Katie Hopkins has to say they should come and say why, rather than try to ban her.""
Ms Hopkins added: ""I welcome everyone to come along. People can be blunt, rude, they can say anything they want, I'm impossible to offend.
""If they want to show me up as a hate speaker, someone with views that are not correct, show me up as being stupid or whatever they think, they are super welcome.""

"Man Booker International Prize: David Grossman wins for stand-up comic novel
Translator Jessica Cohen and author David Grossman split the prize
David Grossman has become the first Israeli author to win the Man Booker International Prize.
He split the £50,000 cash award for his winning book, A Horse Walks Into a Bar, with translator Jessica Cohen.
Chosen from 126 titles, it tells of a stand-up comedian living in a small Israeli town who falls apart on stage in front of an audience.
The Colchester-born author, 63, who was given the award at a ceremony in London, and said he would ""cherish"" it.
Nick Barley, chair of the judging panel, said Grossman had ""attempted an ambitious high-wire act of a novel"" and ""pulled it off spectacularly"".
""A Horse Walks Into A Bar shines a spotlight on the effects of grief, without any hint of sentimentality,"" he added. ""The central character is challenging and flawed, but completely compelling.""
Grossman has been writing since the late 1970s and has won awards in Israel and around the world, with his books being translated into more than 30 languages.
David Grossman was one of two Israeli authors up for the award
To be considered for the prize, books had to be translated into English and published in the UK between 1 May 2016 and 30 April 2017.
. Grossman was up against fellow Israeli author Amos Oz for Judas, Compass by Mathias Enard, The Unseen by Roy Jacobsen, Mirror, Shoulder, Signal by Dorthe Nors and Fever Dream by Samanta Schweblin.
Each shortlisted author and translator automatically receives £1,000.
This is only the second year that the prize has been awarded to a single book. Before 2016, the Man Booker International was awarded every second year to an author for their entire body of work.

"Doctor in the House author Richard Gordon dies aged 95
Richard Gordon once refused to appear on a live broadcast of This Is Your Life
Doctor-turned-author Richard Gordon, who penned the Doctor books in the 1950s and 60s, has died aged 95.
The books formed the basis for seven films and the television and radio comedy series, Doctor in the House.
The plot revolved around the trials of medical students at the fictional St Swithin's Hospital in London.
Under his real name of Gordon Ostlere, the author, who lived in Kent, worked as an anaesthetist in London and Oxford and was also a ship's surgeon.
His first book, Doctor in the House, was based largely on his own experiences.
The film version of the same name starred Dirk Bogarde as the recently qualified Simon Sparrow, and was also made into a stage play.
In total, Gordon wrote more than three dozen books.
His first novel not in the Doctor series was about a plastic surgeon between the wars, which was published in 1967,
He also wrote The Private Life of Florence Nightingale, which depicted her as a lesbian, and similarly titled books on Jack the Ripper and Doctor Crippen.
With his wife, also an anaesthetist, he produced a book for parents, called A Baby in the House.
The author famously refused to appear on This Is Your Life in 1974, where guests were surprised with a big red book and a presentation of their past life.
The television programme was being broadcast live, and when approached by presenter Eamonn Andrews Gordon uttered a five-letter word and walked off.
However, he was persuaded to stay for a show that was broadcast a week later.

There were few Grammy wins by women
Academy president said women need to ""step up""
Despite a strong show of support for the Time's Up movement on the red carpet, where the Grammys' biggest stars donned white roses to support female empowerment, there was a glaring lack of female representation in the winners' list.
And some fans are not happy about it.
Hollywood has been at the forefront of a cultural shift in which movements like Time's Up and #MeToo have put the spotlight squarely on the treatment of women and gender inequality.
All of that served as a backdrop Sunday night as female artists failed to score wins at the 60th Grammy Awards.
Of the major awards televised, Alessia Cara was the only woman to win solo for best new artist.
Two other women, Karen Fairchild and Kimberly Schlapman, won best country duo/group performance as part of the group, Little Big Town.
Women took center stage during Kesha's powerful performance of her hit ""Praying"" as the singer was joined by Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello, Andra Day, Julia Michaels and Bebe Rexha and the Resistance Revival Chorus.
The women, all clad in white, surrounded Kesha and embraced her after an emotional performance which featured lyrics that have become, for some, an anthem for abused and disenfranchised women.
But Lorde, who was the only woman nominated in the best album category, was not scheduled to perform.
that Recording Academy president Neil Portnow had an explanation for that backstage.
""Every year is different, we can't have a performance from every nominee -- we have over 80 categories,"" he said. ""So we have to realize that we've got to create something that has balance, and so on and so forth. And what you saw was our best judgment of how to do that.""
from the audience when Ed Sheeran -- who was not present -- won best pop solo performance for ""Shape of You"" over four women: Kelly Clarkson, Kesha, Lady Gaga and Pink.
Twitter users took to the social platform to comment on the gender gap with the hashtag #GrammysSoMale.

"Rescue dog gets 'new lease of life' with 3D printed leg
Duke was rescued after being abandoned in Ireland and is now walking on four paws for the first time
A dog which could hardly walk has been given a new lease of life after a 3D printed leg was made for him.
Rescue dog Duke, an Irish retriever, was born with a birth defect in his front right leg and faced having it amputated.
But he is now running around after Swansea printing firm CBM made him a leg similar to blades used by Paralympians.
New owner Phil Brown, from Bristol, said it had been ""life changing"".
When Duke was found abandoned by the Irish Retriever Rescue (IRR) charity in Ireland in 2016, his paw was deformed and he could not walk on all fours.
He was taken to the pound and rehomed with foster owners the Browns, who have since adopted him as their own as they could not bear to part with the loveable pooch.
Duke testing out his new leg
Duke could not walk on his front right paw due to a birth defect
After a massive fundraising campaign by the charity Duke has been fitted with a state-of-the-art prosthetic after narrowly avoiding having his foot amputated.
His new owner said Duke, who is now three, was delighted by his new ""super leg"" which meant he was walking on four paws for the first time.
Mr Brown, who owns other dogs which Duke is enjoying playing with, said: ""He had a very tough start in life.
""This is an absolute life changer for him, it really is. He can now walk on it, he can now run at a slow speed.""
Mr Brown said the three-dimensional leg was about a year in a making, and a few months down the line Duke is getting so much use out of it he has already had to have it refurbished.
The leg was entirely printed out of a machine apart from a rubber foot, some Velcro and foam at the top to make it more comfortable for Duke.
Duke, the Irish retriever, was abandoned and had a deformed leg - he is now running around on all fours with the help of a prosthetic leg
The prosthetic leg was made from a 3D printer after a CT scan to make sure it fit Duke perfectly
CBM product designer Benjamin Alport said creating Duke's leg was a real challenge for the team, who worked with his new owner and a consultant orthopaedic surgeon on the design.
""We had to go down and assess Duke. We had to consider right down to the thickness of the hairs because you have to take into account the smallest things,"" he said.

Ariana Grande's manager has said ""fear cannot rule the day"" as he paid tribute to the victims of the Manchester attack.
On Monday, 22 people were killed and 64 injured in a suicide bombing after Grande's concert at Manchester Arena.
, Scooter Braun said: ""With extraordinary evil we must fight with extraordinary greatness.""
""Am I angry? Hell yes. But how will we respond? With everything you think you took from us... love and joy and life.""
His tweets mark the first time he has spoken publicly since the night of the attack, when he said: ""Tonight, our hearts are broken.""
Braun, who also manages Justin Bieber and Carly Rae Jepsen, added: ""Words cannot express our sorrow for the victims and families harmed in this senseless act.""
the concerts she had scheduled over the next two weeks - including two dates London's O2 Arena on Thursday and Friday.
""Tonight I got home and took my parents out to dinner. Korean BBQ. We drank and ate and laughed with the tables next to us. I experienced joy for the first time in days. And I remembered... we are free. We are all different but we are free to enjoy each other's company.
""I will honour those that are lost by living each day full. Full of fun, full of laughter, full of joy. I welcome the differences of my neighbour.
""The wish of terrorism is to take away that feeling of freedom and joy. No. That is my answer. No. We cant allow it. Fear cannot rule the day.
""More people die each year from car crashes then terrorism. Yet I will get in my car. I will choose to live than to be afraid.
""So... Manchester I stand with you. Jakarta I stand with you. Children of Syria I stand with you. We will honour you by not giving in to the darkness.
""And I will honour all of you by laughing loving and living. Living full for every wonderful innocent child whose life was taken to soon.
""So if you think you scared us, if you think your coward[ly] act made us change how we live... sorry. All you did was make us appreciate every day.
""With extraordinary evil we must fight with extraordinary greatness. Fight on. Goodnight world. Tomorrow I live full.

The slogan of their show, featuring models in east London and via video link from New York, was ""we are not sheep"".
Newsbeat's Hannah Moore went behind the scenes as Vin and Omi prepared for the show
Vin and Omi have developed 11 'eco-textiles', including 'leathers' made from the skins of chestnuts, and wool-like fabrics made from recycled plastic bottles.
""It all started when we made this t-shirt made from recycled plastic fabric,"" Omi says.
""When it came back from the manufacturers it was so soft, like a cotton-cashmere blend. From there it became an obsession to see what we could do next.
""The bottles are turned into chips. They're melted and stretched, then turned into yarn that we can weave just like fabric.""
Big fashion brands often produce clothes which end up unsold or sent to landfill.
How long do you keep clothes for?
In the UK, we bought 1.13 million tonnes of clothing in 2016, according to
, but we only tend to keep clothes for an average of three years.
Models held bags made from recycled plastic bags with the slogan ""we are not sheep""
Vin and Omi are also trying a new way of recycling what they've already made.
Customers who get tired of an item can send it back to the designers, who will reuse it in future collections.
The customer then gets a discount off the next thing they buy.
""It's not a very clever practice, because you're actually buying your own clothes back,"" laughs Omi.
""But the point is, it becomes circular. We're making money again by selling new designs.""
Some coats were made from wool sourced from UK smallholdings, said to be more ethically produced
Omi says it's difficult for high street retailers to be ethical if they are producing low-cost clothes and shipping them around the world.
""If a t-shirt costs Â£6, break down the cost. There's no way it's been made in good conditions,"" he says.
Faux leather belts were made from chestnut
But there are signs the industry is changing.
The British Fashion Council, which oversees designers, has launched an initiative called Positive Fashion, which rewards designers who, like Vin and Omi, meet certain ethical standards.
This includes things like manufacturing in the UK and switching to green energy sources.
""We as designers are the culprits, because we make things to inspire people,"" adds Omi.
""But as a single designer I can't change the industry.""

"World's most expensive dram of Scotch was a fake
The dram was bought for £7,600
A dram of vintage Scotch bought by a Chinese millionaire in a Swiss hotel bar for £7,600 was a fake, laboratory tests have concluded.
Analysts from Scotland were called in by the Waldhaus Hotel Am See in St Moritz after experts questioned the authenticity of the 2cl shot.
It had been poured from an unopened bottle labelled as an 1878 Macallan single malt.
It is believed to be the largest sum ever paid for a poured dram of Scotch.
But analysis found that it was almost certainly not distilled before 1970.
The hotel said it had accepted the findings and reimbursed the customer in full.
Zhang Wei, 36, from Beijing - one of China's highest-earning online writers - had paid just under 10,000 Swiss francs (£7,600) for the single shot while visiting the hotel's Devil's Place whisky bar in July.
But suspicions about the spirit's provenance surfaced soon after the purchase, when whisky industry experts spotted discrepancies in the bottle's cork and label from newspaper articles.
Mr Zhang was photographed with hotel manager Sandro Bernasconi after buying the dram
That prompted the Waldhaus to send a sample to Dunfermline-based specialists Rare Whisky 101 (RW101) for analysis.
Carbon dating tests were then carried out by researchers from the University of Oxford, which suggested a 95% probability that the spirit was created between 1970 and 1972.
Further lab tests by Fife-based alcohol analysts Tatlock and Thomson indicated that it was probably a blended Scotch, comprising 60% malt and 40% grain - ruling it out as a single malt.
RW101 said the tests had shown that the bottle was ""almost worthless as a collector's item"".
Had the bottle been genuine, it would have carried a bar-value of about 300,000 Swiss francs (£227,000).
The dram was poured from an unopened bottle that purported to be an 1878 Macallan
Mr Zhang, who writes martial arts fantasy novels under the pen name Tang Jia San Shao, earned the equivalent of about $16.8m in 2015,
He bought the dram while on holiday with his grandmother at the Swiss hotel, which stocks 2,500 different whiskies.
Waldhaus manager Sandro Bernasconi told BBC Scotland that the hotel had no idea the bottle was a fake.
He said: ""My father bought the bottle of Macallan 25 years ago, when he was manager of this hotel, and it had not been opened.
""When Mr Zhang asked if he could try some, we told him it wasn't for sale. When he said he really wanted to try it, I called my father who told me we could wait another 20 years for a customer like that so we should sell it.
""Mr Zhang and I then opened the bottle together and drank some of it.""
Mr Zhang wrote about his experience with the ""1878"" Macallan a few days after his visit to the Waldhaus hotel
A few days after tasting the whisky, Mr Zhang posted a message on the Chinese micro-blogging platform Weibo about his experience.
He wrote in Mandarin: ""When I came across a fine spirit from over 100 years ago, there wasn't much struggle inside.
""My grandma who accompanied me on this trip was only 82, yet the alcohol was 139 years old - same age as my grandma's grandma.
""To answer you all, it had a good taste. It's not just the taste, but also history.""
The dram was bought from the Devil's Place whisky bar in St Moritz
Mr Bernasconi broke the bad news to Mr Zhang when he flew out to China to reimburse him recently.
He added: ""When I showed him the results, he was not angry - he thanked me very much for the hotel's honesty and said his experience in Switzerland had been good.
""When it comes to selling our customers some of the world's rarest and oldest whiskies, we felt it was our duty to ensure that our stock is 100% authentic and the real deal.
""That's why we called in RW101.
""The result has been a big shock to the system, and we are delighted to have repaid our customer in full as a gesture of goodwill.""
RW101 co-founder David Robertson said: ""The Waldhaus team did exactly the right thing by trying to authenticate this whisky.
""We would implore that others in the market do what they can to identify any rogue bottles.
""The more intelligence we can provide, the greater the chance we have to defeat the fakers and fraudsters who seek to dupe the unsuspecting rare whisky consumer.""

"UK retailers 'need EU workers after Brexit'
Prices may rise and home deliveries could be slower unless the retail sector retains access to all EU workers after Brexit, a trade body has warned.
EU citizens account for just 6% of the industry's 170,000 workforce, the British Retail Consortium said.
However, they are concentrated in warehouse and distribution jobs, its annual workforce survey showed.
More than half of retailers said their EU employees were worried about their right to remain in the UK.
Just over a fifth of retail firms had had some European staff leave the UK already, the BRC survey found.
The trade body said ending of free movement for EU nationals could lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers, ""from the service delivered in a store to next day delivery of an online order ... to the prices of what you buy"".
It argued that the retail sector should keep access to non-graduate European workers without the need for employer sponsorship after the UK leaves the EU.
BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said the Brexit decision had created uncertainty for both business and their EU workers.
""It is not right that 16 months after the referendum these people still don't have the security they need to continue their lives,"" she said.
""And from our data it is clear that unless we have the right structures in place to support retailers attract, recruit and retain workers, consumers will soon start to see and feel an impact as they shop.""
John Hannett, general secretary of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW), said: ""The sector will continue to need EU workers to come and work in retail, distribution and food manufacturing. We need a debate, based on facts and evidence, as to what that post-Brexit retail sector will look like.""
A government spokesperson said: ""After we leave the EU we will have an immigration system which works in the best interests of the UK. Crucial to the development of this will be the views from a range of businesses.
""We have asked the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to assess the role EU citizens play in the UK economy and society. Their independent process will allow employers to submit their thoughts to an influential group of experts, independent of government.""

Vice digital chief out after suspension over sexual harassment allegations
January 30, 2018: 3:28 PM ET
Culture changes amid harassment tipping point?
A top executive at Vice Media who had been suspended over sexual misconduct allegations has left the company.
In an email to staff on Tuesday, Vice COO and CFO Sarah Broderick said that Mike Germano, the company's chief digital officer, will not be returning.
Germano, along with company president Andrew Creighton, were both put on leave at the beginning of the month following a New York Times story that included allegations against them.
The Times spoke to two women who accused Germano of inappropriate behavior. One claimed that Germano told her he didn't want to hire her because he wanted to have sex with her; the other said he pulled her on his lap at a work event in a bar.
Germano, who founded Vice's digital advertising agency Carrot Creative, did not respond to a request for comment. He told the Times in a statement that he apologized for the incident at the bar, which he was ""resolved with the help of HR.""
The Times story provided details on four settlements over allegations of sexual harassment or defamation against Vice employees, including one involving Creighton. In that settlement, which was reached in 2016, an ex-employee was paid $135,000 after claiming that she was fired after rejecting a relationship with Creighton, although Vice denied the allegations and said she had been ousted for poor performance.
Broderick did not address Creighton's status in her email, which was obtained by CNNMoney. A Vice spokesman said the investigation into Creighton is ""still ongoing.""
In her email Tuesday, Broderick said that Vice's creative agency, Virtue Worldwide, is ""finalizing the long planned integration"" of Carrot.

"China orders Bitcoin exchanges in capital city to close
Chinese regulators have issued strict instructions on how Bitcoin exchanges should dismantle their operations
China is moving forward with plans to shut down Bitcoin exchanges in the country, starting with trading platforms in key cities.
All Bitcoin exchanges in Beijing and Shanghai have been ordered to submit plans for winding down their operations by 20 September.
The move follows the Chinese central bank's decision to
Chinese authorities decided to ban digital currencies as part of a plan for reducing the country's financial risks.
A website set up by the Chinese central bank warned that cryptocurrencies are ""increasingly used as a tool in criminal activities such as money laundering, drug trafficking, smuggling, and illegal fundraising"".
According to a document leaked online
, Chinese regulators ordered all cryptocurrency exchanges in Beijing to stop registering new user registration by midnight local time on 15 September, and to notify users publicly when they formally close.
All exchanges are required to send regulators a detailed ""risk-free"" plan of how they intend to exit the market before 18:30 local time on Wednesday 20 September.
The regulator also ordered the exchanges to submit DVDs containing all user trading and holding data to the local authorities.
Shareholders, controllers, executives, and core financial and technical staff of exchanges are also required to remain in Beijing during the shutdown and to co-operate fully with authorities.
""China is shutting the exchanges down for good reasons - I think it's right they're being cautious at this time,"" Paul Armstrong, an emerging technology adviser and author of the book
""Bitcoin is by proxy unregulated and peer-to-peer, it's a very volatile currency.""
However, Mr Armstrong does not think that this will be the end of Bitcoin in China for good.
""They're shutting it down for now, but it doesn't mean that in six months or so they won't create new Bitcoin regulations
""All the other countries have digital currencies and are making important decisions about it, so it doesn't make sense for China to dismiss it out of hand.""
He added that China's decision could prompt Chinese investors to seek alternative options to digital currencies, such as moving out of the country and operating exchanges or Bitcoin mining pools in other regions.

"Holland & Barrett sold for £1.8bn to Russian billionaire
Mikhail Fridman's L1 Retail fund is buying Holland & Barrett
Holland & Barrett, the UK's biggest health food retailer, is being bought by a Russian billionaire for £1.8bn.
L1 Retail, a fund controlled by Mikhail Fridman, is buying the 1,150-store chain from Carlyle, the US private equity firm, the Financial Times reported.
Carlyle acquired Holland & Barrett as part of its $3.8bn purchase in 2010 of US firm Nature's Bounty, now NBTY.
The chain has about 600 stores in the UK as well as China, India and the UAE.
The retailer, which employs more than 4,000 people, was founded in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, in 1870.
Holland & Barrett has opened more than 300 stores in the seven years since the private equity takeover, the Financial Times reported.
The purchase is the first by L1 Retail, which was set up in late 2016.
It aims to invest $3bn in a small number of retail businesses that it believes can be market leaders by ""moving with and leading long-term trends"".
The fund's advisory board includes John Walden, the former chief executive of Home Retail Group.
The company owned Argos and Homebase before selling both chains last year.
Other members are Karl-Heinz Holland, who was chief executive of Lidl Group, the German supermarket chain; and Clive Humby, one of the founders of dunnhumby, which came up with the idea for Tesco's Clubcard.
L1 also has funds focused on energy, technology and health.
Peter Aldis, Holland & Barrett chief executive, is expected to stay on.
Mr Fridman is best known for his role as chief executive of BP's Russian joint venture TNK between 2003 and 2012, when it was sold to Rosneft for $56bn.
Mervyn Davies, the former Standard Chartered chief executive who is now Lord Davies of Abersoch, is chairman of L1 Holdings.

"Valtteri Bottas: Finnish driver signs new deal with Mercedes
Updated 1308 GMT (2108 HKT) September 13, 2017
Valtteri Bottas has been rewarded for his flying start as a Mercedes driver with a one-year contract extension. The Finn has won two Grands Prix this year: Austria (pictured) and Russia.
Lewis Hamilton endured a tense relationship with former Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, but both Bottas and executive director Toto Wolff have praised the new pair's successful partnership.
Champagne moment: Bottas won his first F1 race at the Russian Grand Prix.
Bottas qualified in third place for the Russian Grand Prix behind pole sitter Sebastian Vettel and his Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen but overtook both men at the start of the first lap.
Bottas was chased hard by Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel but held off the German's challenge to claim a maiden win in his 81st F1 race start. Bottas joins an elite group of Finns -- Mika Hakkinen, Kimi Raikkonen, Heikki Kovalainen and Keke Rosberg -- who have won an F1 grand prix.
The Sochi track is set among the Olympic venues that hosted the Winter Games in 2014 -- the same year of the inaugural Russian Grand Prix.
Bottas joined world champions Mercedes in January after four seasons at Williams Racing. ""I feel like I have plenty to prove, not much to lose ... more to win,"" Valtteri Bottas told CNN.
The Finn's first taste of an F1 podium came at the 2014 Austrian Grand Prix where he came third.
Bottas finished fourth overall in the 2014 F1 Drivers' Championship.
Alongside teammate Felipe Massa, the Williams pair couldn't match the dominance of Hamilton and Rosberg at Mercedes.
The Finn's only podium in 2016 came at the Canadian Grand Prix in June.
In January 2017, after four seasons and nine podiums with Williams, it was announced that Bottas would
Bottas claimed his first-ever F1 pole at April's Bahrain Grand Prix but couldn't convert it into a win. The Finn ended up in third behind teammate Lewis Hamilton (far left) and race winner, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.
Bottas signs new Mercedes deal for 2018
Finn has enjoyed successful first season with new team
Valtteri Bottas has been rewarded with a one-year contract extension for his excellent start to life as a Mercedes driver.
The new deal will see the Finn -- who sits in third in the drivers' championship on 197 points -- continue to drive for the Silver Arrows in the 2018 season.
""I am honored and proud to continue to work with Mercedes and to remain part of the Mercedes family,"" Bottas said in a statement.
""Together, we continue to grow stronger day by day, and by keeping up our hard work I believe the sky is the limit. Since joining the team in January, I've enjoyed every day working with them.
I'm happy and honored to confirm that I will be racing with
— Valtteri Bottas (@ValtteriBottas)
""The welcome and the support from every team member and all the fans has been invaluable. As a driver, I've been able to learn and grow massively, and we have already enjoyed some really good moments this season that I will never forget.""
In just 13 races, Bottas has delivered nine podiums for Mercedes, the same amount he managed in four years with previous team Williams.
The 28-year-old was signed as a last-minute replacement by Mercedes for reigning F1 champion Nico Rosberg, who announced his shock retirement less than a week after winning his maiden title.
""We gave Valtteri a big challenge this year: joining the team at the eleventh hour, stepping up to the forefront of F1 and pairing with the sport's best driver as his teammate,"" said Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff, referring to Lewis Hamilton, who currently leads the drivers' championship.
""With that in mind, his results have been probably even more impressive,"" added Wolff. ""There have been ups and downs -- more ups, fewer downs -- and some great highlights like his two race wins in Russian and Austria.

— Mercedes-AMG F1 (@MercedesAMGF1)
""Overall, the balance of his performances and his upward trajectory made it a no-brainer for us to continue with him into 2018.""
Rosberg and Hamilton drew criticism last season for their often tetchy relationship, which included a collision on the final lap of the Austrian Grand Prix.
However, both Bottas and Wolff highlighted the impressive working partnership that the pair have built in their opening nine months together.
""For our team, the bonus factors are the respect and sportsmanship that have grown between our two drivers,"" Wolff said.
""The chemistry and dynamic between Valtteri and Lewis work and are what we need to take the fight to our competitors.""
Bottas, meanwhile, said he is ""enjoying the respect"" he has with Hamilton and their mutual ""will to push this team forward together.""

"General election 2017: PM vows to end 'rip-off' energy bills
Theresa May has vowed to end the ""injustice"" of rising energy costs by including a cap in the Conservative general election manifesto.
The PM said the energy market ""is not working"", with vulnerable people worst hit by ""rip-off"" bills.
Industry figures have criticised the plan, first announced last month, saying it could lead to higher prices.
Labour, which offered its own bill cap ahead of the 2015 election, accused the Tories of ""desperate stuff"".
It challenged the Tories to guarantee bills would not rise next year under a Conservative government.
Under the Conservative proposal, industry watchdog Ofgem would set a cap for the default standard variable tariffs, which are often criticised as bad deals for consumers by industry watchdogs.
""Like millions of working families, I am fed up with rip-off energy prices,"" Mrs May wrote in The Sun.
""Gas and electricity bills only ever seem to go in one direction, eating up more and more of your monthly pay packet.""
The PM said five of the ""big six"" energy companies had recently raised prices while their profit margins hit ""record levels"".
She added: ""And it is the vulnerable, and those on low incomes, who are being hit hardest.
""It is clear to me that the energy market is not working for ordinary working families. Too many people simply aren't getting a fair deal.""
British Gas owner Centrica said it did not believe in ""any form of price regulation"".
In a trading update, the firm said: ""Evidence from other countries would suggest this will lead to reduced competition and choice, and potentially higher average prices.""
According to Citizens Advice, about 800,000 of the poorest pensioners and 1.5 million low-income families with children are on standard variable tariffs.
These households are paying an average of Â£141 more a year for a dual fuel gas and electricity bill than if they were on the cheapest deal, it said.
Last year, the Competition and Markets Authority recommended a cap on pre-paid energy bills - a measure that was introduced last month - but decided that to extend this to all standard variable customers would ""run excessive risks of undermining the competitive process - notably by reducing the incentives of customers to engage and increasing regulatory risk - likely resulting in worse outcomes for customers in the long run"".
Under former leader Ed Miliband, Labour went into the 2015 general election promising to freeze energy bills, saying they would be able to fall but not rise.
Responding to the Tories' latest comments, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Rebecca Long-Bailey said: ""This is desperate stuff from the Tories, re-announcing something they tried to get a headline for just a fortnight ago. But just as when they announced it last time, there's still no proper detail nor any real commitment to helping working people.
""When the Tories say they'll 'cap' bills, the question they need to answer is whether they can guarantee bills won't go up for people next year - that's the real test. A cap suggests a maximum amount that can be charged, not a promise that bills won't go up year on year.""
Lib Dem former energy secretary Ed Davey said: ""It is never a good idea to copy the economic strategy of Ed Miliband. As the Conservatives pointed out at the time, this will damage investment in energy when it is needed more than ever.""
The main parties have yet to publish their full manifestos ahead of the 8 June general election.

"Jeremy Corbyn backs CBI demand for Brexit transition deal
Theresa May must agree a Brexit transition deal ""immediately"" to end uncertainty for business, Jeremy Corbyn has told the CBI's conference.
The Labour leader backed a call from the business group to get such an agreement by the end of the year.
Mrs May has attempted to reassure business leaders they will get plenty of time to make new arrangements after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.
She has yet to start talks on her call for a two-year transition period.
But she told the CBI conference in London she wanted the talks to start ""as early as possible"".
She has previously suggested they can't begin until the UK's sorts out its ""future partnership"" with the EU, something that might not happen until the middle of next year, if at all.
But some businesses - including BT - have warned that unless the terms of a transitional period were clear by January they would have to start planning for a ""hard Brexit"".
That was a message echoed by Mr Corbyn as he told the CBI conference that the transitional arrangements had to be agreed immediately ""so that businesses know they won't face a cliff-edge Brexit when the two year negotiating period is up"".
""Because let me be clear: to delay a transition deal until a final deal is agreed as the prime minister says she wants to do, is simply not good enough.
""The prospect of sudden changes in the legal and regulatory environment in which people do business is affecting... decisions right now.""
He also warned about the ""nightmare scenario"" of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal, which he claimed would lead to ""tariffs on our food imports and our manufacturing exports, queues at our ports and a hard border in Northern Ireland with all the dangers that could bring"".
He added: ""The fact that some in the cabinet want 'no deal' to re-launch Britain as a race-to-the-bottom deregulated tax haven on the shores of Europe only adds to the risks.""
Last month the CBI and other business groups warned the UK risks losing jobs and investment unless a transition deal is agreed by the end of the year.
But the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said he will not discuss transition terms until the UK has settled its divorce issues, including its exit bill.
Mrs May told MPs last month the UK could not ""put in place the practical changes necessary to move to the future partnership"" until it knows ""what that future partnership is going to be"".
But she used her speech to the CBI to address concerns businesses will face a ""cliff edge"" in March 2019.
""I have made clear that a strictly time-limited implementation period will be crucial to our future success.
""I know how important it is for business and industry not to face a cliff-edge and to have the time it needs to plan and prepare for the new arrangements.
""During this period our access to one another's markets should continue on current terms, and I want us to agree the detailed arrangements for this period as early as possible.
""But we should also be able to develop our relationships with countries outside the EU in new ways, including through our own trade negotiations.""
The CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was now ""cross-party agreement"" that a transition deal was needed ""as soon as possible"" and ""so this is the time for urgent action"".

"Jeremy Corbyn to US and North Korea: Ratchet down the rhetoric
Jeremy Corbyn has called on Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un to ""ratchet down the rhetoric"" and said the situation between their countries was ""obviously extremely dangerous"".
The Labour leader called for talks and said he hoped one day North Korea would enter the ""orbit of the rest of the world"".
North Korea has threatened to fire missiles into the US territory of Guam.
This was in response to the US president's warning of ""fire and fury"".
Mr Trump has also boasted about America's nuclear arsenal, while unconfirmed reports claim Pyongyang might have made a nuclear warhead small enough to fit onto a missile.
Mr Corbyn, a longstanding anti nuclear campaigner, said the idea of anyone using nuclear weapons was ""unthinkable"".
""We don't need a world with nuclear weapons, and there's no such thing as an isolated nuclear strike and so we need to ratchet down the rhetoric on both sides,"" he said.
He added: ""Hopefully one day North Korea will come into the orbit of the rest of the world... there is no such thing as an isolated nuclear attack, it would kill millions, on both sides of the Korean border and of course in neighbouring countries.""
Asked about President Trump's ""fire and fury"" warning, Damian Green, the UK's first secretary of state, said: ""Let's hope it doesn't come to that.""
He added: ""That's why we are operating as hard as we can through the proper diplomatic channels to make sure that we see a de-escalation of tensions.""
Tensions have increased in recent days, with North Korea saying a plan that could see it fire four missiles near Guam will be ready in a matter of days, if approved by Kim Jong-un.
It described President Trump as ""bereft of reason"".
The US has warned the North its actions could mean the ""end of its regime"".
US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said Pyongyang would be ""grossly overmatched"" in any war against the US and its allies.

Kosei Inoue: 'The battle will always continue'
Kosei Inoue reveals he feels ""pressure"" ahead of Tokyo 2020
Japan judo coach guided team to 12 gold medals at Tokyo Grand Slam
Former Olympic champion tells CNN: ""The battle will always continue""
For Kosei Inoue, reaching the pinnacle of his sport is just the start of the journey.
His team might have won 12 of the 14 gold medals on offer at the recent Tokyo Grand Slam, but the Japanese judo head coach preaches caution.
""The battle will always continue,"" Inoue tells CNN's Judo World. ""It's important for the athletes who performed well at the Tokyo Grand Slam to never be satisfied, to always stay hungry, and to have high goals and expectations for themselves.""
It's a message the 39-year-old has always taken to heart, from his early days on the tatami to his current stint inspiring the next generation.
Inoue would train relentlessly as a child, only stopping when forced by his teachers. At the Sydney 2000 Olympics, the half-heavyweight judoka didn't just content himself with gold, but won every single match by ippon.
Japan: Welcome to the home of judo
Japan: Welcome to the home of judo
Such refusal to settle for second best allowed him to dominate the sport, claiming three World Championship titles between 1999 and 2003.
""The Japanese system is like no other when it comes to creating champions,"" he says. ""First, they start judo typically in a school, then they move to middle school, high school, to university, and finally to a company.

""Or they become a teacher. And there are many, very enthusiastic and supportive teachers along the way. This is probably one of the biggest fundamental differences compared to other countries -- the amount of passionate sensei and instructors.""
Inoue is one such leader, having transformed Japan's judo fortunes on the international stage since taking over at the team's lowest ebb five years ago.
At the London 2012 Olympic Games, Japan's men's team ended up with zero gold medals for the first time in Olympic history, prompting widespread derision in the birthplace of the sport.
Since lnoue's arrival, everything has changed. Japan topped the medal table at both the Rio 2016 Olympic Games and the 2017 World Championships in Budapest.
""I had the opportunity to become the coach of the men's national team at the age of 34,"" he recalls. ""This is a very young age to become national team head coach, but I was very proud to be given this opportunity after the failure at the London Olympic games.""

Inoue contends he's ""very inexperienced"" even to this day, despite the wealth of medals and global acclaim. And, with Tokyo 2020 on the horizon, he's not afraid to admit he carries the weight of a country's expectations on his shoulders.
One thing he'll never do is rest on his laurels.
'You get thrown and you stand up again'
Kosei Inoue is a judoka who has followed up a formidable career by becoming coach of the Japanese national team. A flagbearer for his country at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, he also won his first gold medal in the -100kg category.
'You get thrown and you stand up again'
Inoue defeated Nicolas Gill of Canada in the final. He carried a photo of his mother, who had died one year prior to the Games, onto the podium. ""To me, she was the best mother in the world and I wanted the world to see her,"" Inoue said at the time.
'You get thrown and you stand up again'
Inoue coached Japan at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, where his team came away with 12 medals -- including three gold.
'You get thrown and you stand up again'
""We look at judo not only as a sport but as a 'budo,' or martial way,"" Inoue tells CNN. ""There is the competition -- we come to a World Championships and aim to win a gold medal -- but there is something far bigger behind this.""
'You get thrown and you stand up again'
Inoue delights the home crowd by throwing Ghislain Lemaire of France to win gold at the 2003 World Championships in Osaka.
'You get thrown and you stand up again'
Inoue sits dejected after a loss to Dutch opponent Elco van Der Geest in men's -100 kg competition at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games.
""As a coach, I feel great responsibility to perform at the Olympic Games,"" he says. ""I'm teaching the athletes to take in the pressure, accept it and to do what they need to do; to think about it as individuals, judokas and lifelong learners.
""I too will continue to study and learn. And this in turn will flow down to the team.""
After all, Inoue points out, ""judo will continue"" beyond the Tokyo Olympics.
""It is very important to think about what judo will be 50 years from now, 100 years from now,"" he says.
""We always need to constantly think about judo's development. And what we can do to spread the sport and discipline. Through these years, through the long history of judo, there are many people who have had great influence.
""It's always important to keep in mind the tradition and the work of the people before, but also to step into new realms and break new ground.""

"Dixons Carphone warns on profit as mobile sales hit
The owner of Carphone Warehouse and Dixons has warned that more expensive mobile phone handsets and lower EU roaming charges will hurt its profits.
Shares fell 20% after it said pre-tax profits this year would be £360m to £440m, down from £501m last year.
Dixons Carphone said customers were not upgrading their phones as frequently because handsets had risen in price.
It also predicted it would take a hit from the EU scrapping roaming charges for people using mobile phones abroad.
Chief executive Seb James said in an

The fall in the pound had made handsets more expensive and innovation of phones has been ""incremental"", Mr James said.
""As a consequence, we have seen an increased number of people hold on to their phones for longer,"" he said.
He added it was too soon to say whether upcoming Samsung and iPhone handset launches would reverse the trend.

"Election 2017: Tory manifesto says 'public consent' needed for indyref2
Theresa May unveiled the Conservative manifesto in Halifax
A second independence referendum will not be held unless there is ""public consent"" for it to happen, the Conservative election manifesto says.
It also pledges there will be no vote on the issue ""until the Brexit process has played out"".
But the manifesto, which was launched by Theresa May in Halifax, does not specify what ""public consent"" means.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants a referendum to be held in the autumn of next year or spring of 2019.
Her call was formally backed by the Scottish Parliament in March - although it was opposed by the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats, with the Scottish Greens backing the SNP in the final vote.
The prime minister has repeatedly said that ""now is not the time"" for another vote on the issue, arguing that the focus should instead be on negotiating the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK.
But Ms Sturgeon argues that the Scottish people should be able to choose which path to follow in the wake of the Brexit vote, and that blocking a referendum would be a ""democratic outrage"".
The Conservative manifesto claims that ""some would disrupt our attempts to get the best deal for Scotland and the United Kingdom with calls for a divisive referendum that the people of Scotland do not want"".
It goes on to say: ""We have been very clear that now is not the time for another referendum on independence.
""In order for a referendum to be fair, legal and decisive, it cannot take place until the Brexit process has played out and it should not take place unless there is public consent for it to happen.
""This is a time to pull together, not apart.""
Voters rejected independence by 55% to 45% in the 2014 referendum
Mrs May said the manifesto contained proposals that would ""see us through Brexit and beyond"", describing it as a ""plan for a stronger, fairer, more prosperous Britain"".
She has promised a ""mainstream government that would deliver for mainstream Britain"" if she wins the election on 8 June.
The manifesto includes a fresh pledge to curb immigration, and says the government will deliver a balanced budget by the ""middle of the next decade"".
On Brexit, it pledges to negotiate a ""deep and special partnership"" which will allow free trade between the UK and the EU's member states, but with the UK leaving the single market and customs union.
It also says there will be no increase in VAT, and promises to increase the national living wage to 60% of the median earnings by 2020.
And it says the so-called ""triple lock"" on pensions will be reduced to a ""double lock"" with the state pension to rise by the higher of average earnings or inflation - but it will no longer go up by 2.5% if they are both lower than that.
The manifesto says Scotland's economic growth has lagged behind the rest of the United Kingdom in recent years, but that the Conservatives ""take seriously our duty to secure prosperity for the whole of the United Kingdom"".
The document pledges: ""We will, therefore, take concerted action to help secure the long-term sustainability of the Scottish economy. Scotland and Scottish industries will be central to our industrial strategy.""
This action will include:
Backing Scotland's energy sector - including creating a world-leading decommissioning industry in the North Sea and a commitment to remote island wind development
Building on the City and Growth deals that have been signed across Scotland
Bringing forward a Borderlands Growth Deal to help secure prosperity in southern Scotland
Protecting the interests of Scottish farmers and fishermen as part of a new UK farming and fisheries policy
Using the ""United Kingdom's muscle"" to promote Scottish exports around the world
Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who was the only Conservative MP elected in Scotland in the 2015 general election, described the manifesto as a ""plan that delivers for Scotland"".
He added: ""It shows that a re-elected Conservative government will continue to ensure that Scotland benefits from its membership of the United Kingdom.""
The SNP said the Conservative manifesto was a ""cruel and callous attack on families"" with planned cuts that it said would hit pensioners, working families and public services.
The party's deputy leader, Angus Robertson, said: ""The SNP already protect free personal care, free childcare, free school meals, and will stand up against these callous Tory cuts.""
He went on to claim the Conservatives have ""made a rod for their own back"" over independence, because ""if they now fail to win the election in Scotland they have no basis whatsoever on which to continue to thwart the will of the Scottish Parliament"".
Meanwhile, James Kelly of Scottish Labour said the Conservative ""ideological obsession with a hard Brexit"" had allowed the SNP to kick-start a fresh campaign for independence.
He added: ""This Tory manifesto means every Conservative candidate in Scotland is standing on a platform endorsing the abhorrent rape clause, the bedroom tax and swingeing cuts to social security payments.
""There is now a clear choice between a radical vision of a fairer UK with a Labour government, or Theresa May' Little Britain, closed off from the world and building borders as nationalist governments always do.""

"How to celebrate 'Mean Girls Day'
Updated 1343 GMT (2143 HKT) October 3, 2017
Photos: 'Mean Girls': Where are they now?
""On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was."" This memorable quote from the 2004 film ""Mean Girls"" from lead character Cady Heron has inspired annual tributes to the quotable cult classic on October 3. The teen flick launched the careers of Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, Rachel McAdams and Lacey Chabert and others. Let's catch up with where they are now:
Photos: 'Mean Girls': Where are they now?
Daniel Franzese (seen here with Lindsay Lohan and Lizzy Caplan) plays the witty sidekick Damian, who was ""too gay to function."" Caplan plays Janis Ian, who is determined to take down the Plastics, aka the most popular girls in their high school.
Photos: 'Mean Girls': Where are they now?
In 2014, Franzese revealed he is also gay in real life. His professional career since the film has included roles in ""Party Down' and ""Burn Notice"" as well as the 2010 film ""I Spit On Your Grave."" Most recently he played Jackson Morrison on the TV series ""Conviction.""
Photos: 'Mean Girls': Where are they now?
Caplan later starred in another cult classic, ""Hot Tub Time Machine."" She also had a critically acclaimed role in the Showtime original series ""Masters of Sex"" and made appearances on ""The Simpsons"" and ""Angie tribeca.""
Photos: 'Mean Girls': Where are they now?
Lacey Chabert, left, plays Gretchen Wieners and Rachel McAdams plays the leader of the Plastics, Regina George.
Photos: 'Mean Girls': Where are they now?
McAdams has gone on to find fame in films like ""The Notebook,"" ""Wedding Crashers,"" and ""A Most Wanted Man."" She starred alongside Colin Farrell and Taylor Kitsch in season two of the hit HBO series ""True Detective."" She has also made headlines for her romances, including with ""Notebook"" co-star Ryan Gosling.
Photos: 'Mean Girls': Where are they now?
Chabert was already pretty famous for her role as Claudia Salinger on the hit 1990s TV drama ""Party of Five."" Since ""Mean Girls,"" she has stayed busy in Hollywood with voice work on animated shows like ""The Spectacular Spider-Man,"" ""The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes,"" and ""Transformers: Rescue Bots.""
Photos: 'Mean Girls': Where are they now?
Jonathan Bennett plays the hunky Aaron Samuels, who finds a love connection with Lindsay Lohan's character, Cady.
Photos: 'Mean Girls': Where are they now?
Bennett used his role in ""Mean Girls"" as a career stepping stone and went on to star in the 2009 film ""Van Wilder: Freshman Year,"" and a part in the 2013 TV series ""The Glades."" He also played Ethan on the TV series ""Awkward.""

Of everyone, Fey arguably has the biggest career. From her time on ""Saturday Night Live"" to her creation of and starring role in NBC's ""30 Rock,"" she is one of Hollywood's most successful funny women. So much so that she and BFF Amy Poehler pretty much set the standard for hosting awards shows after co-hosting the Golden Globes for three years straight in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Co-creating the Netflix comedy ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" has further cemented her rep as a Hollywood power player and she made fans dreams come true with the announcement of a ""Mean Girls"" Broadway musical in 2018.

In the years since ""Mean Girls"" was released, Lohan has become as well-known for her appearances in the courtroom as in films. In 2014 she embarked on a comeback attempt that included a docu-series on OWN and appearances like this one on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."" These days Lohan spends most of her time overseas and has made headlines for her humanitarian relief work with Syrian refugees. She also landed a role on season 2 of the British comedy ""Sick Note.""

October 3 is unofficially ""Mean Girls Day""
Lohan recently rewatched the movie
No, you don't get the day off. But that doesn't mean that October 3 isn't a holiday.
The date is known to social media and movie fans around the world as ""Mean Girls Day.""
Here's the backstory: In the popular 2004 film there's scene where Aaron Samuels (portrayed by Jonathan Bennett) turns to Cady Heron (played by Lindsay Lohan) in class and asks her what day it is.
""It's October 3,"" she answers.
Since then, October 3 has joined other dates made significant by films.
So how should you celebrate it?
Try and score some tickets to the ""Mean Girls"" musical
""30 Rock"" funny woman Tina Fey wrote the film and is now blessing the world with a musical version, which is premiering for a five-week run at Washington's National Theater on October 31 and later heading to Broadway.
Naturally, the tickets go on sale Tuesday.
If you are in New York on October 3, there is a planned celebration at the August Wilson Theatre featuring cheese fries from Sweetery's.
Eat cheese fries or Taco Bell
Who can forget the character Regina George's classic line, ""Whatever, I'm getting cheese fries.""
Or her assertion that she couldn't eat Taco Bell as she was on an ""all carb diet.""
Try and make ""fetch' happen
Speaking of Regina George, she was so right when she said fetch isn't going to happen. But you can still try and give the slang word some love by using it.
Go follow Lindsay Lohan on social media
It's ok to admit that you are still a little obsessed with the red-headed starlet who went from ingenue to inmate at one point.
Lohan still has love for the movie that helped make her a star. Just a few days ago, she shared an Instagram story of herself re-watching ""Mean Girls"" to the thrill of her followers.
LINDSAY LOHAN WATCHING MEAN GIRLS MAKES ME SO EMOTIONAL
— PRADASLUT (@angeIicHOE)
The actress told CNN last year
interview that she's ""been trying so hard to do a 'Mean Girls 2.' It is not in my hands.""
""I know Tina Fey and Lorne Michaels and all of Paramount are very busy,"" Lohan said. ""But I will keep forcing it and pushing it on them until we do it.""
Take a page from Lohan and watch ""Mean Girls"" in honor of ""Mean Girls Day.""

Twitter said it was investigating the problem and taking steps to avoid it happening again.

"Female film casting same as 100 years ago
Naomie Harris became the first black actress to play Miss Moneypenny
The percentage of women being cast in UK films has barely changed in more than 100 years, data released by the British Film Institute (BFI) shows.
In 1913, 26% of the cast in 53 films was female and of the 74 films made so far in 2017, the percentage is 28%.
However, the percentage of women crew members went up from 3% to 33% over the same period of time.
also shows that 59% of films made in the last 10 years had no black actors in lead or named roles.
While the number of leading female characters is roughly the same today as in 1913, the figure has dropped in between.
In the 1930s, only 24% of cast members were female and the figure stayed between 25% and 27% until the 1990s, when it rose to 29%.
Andrea Arnold has worked on several films, including last year's American Honey
The filmography has been launched by the BFI as ""the world's first complete and accurate living record of UK cinema"", enabling anyone to research British film history for free.
It is taking a detailed look at gender to try to obtain a better understanding of representation in front of and behind the camera.
While a third of crew members were female last year, that figure was still below the UK workforce average.
Overall, less than 1% of crews contained a majority of female members (23 out of more than 10,000) and only 4.5% of films are directed by women.
Dr Vicky Ball, a lecturer in cinema and television history at De Montfort University, told the BBC: ""Jobs in the film industry have been gendered. Technical jobs have been aligned with masculinity. The predominant role for women was in administration and costume design.
""It's always good to have a diversity of voices, otherwise whose values are being represented?""
More films have been made about Queen Victoria (25) than James Bond (21)
Nearly four times as many comedy films (2,347) have been made than romances (625)
There have been more films made with Europe as a subject (527) than Great Britain (431)
The most prolific currently working male actor is Michael Caine (70 films) while Dame Judi Dench is the most prolific female (41)
Wally Patch was the male actor who appeared in most films (195 between 1927 to 1968) and Marianne Stone made the most female appearances (162 between 1948 to 1985)
Lewis Gilbert, whose credits include James Bond, is the most prolific living director (33 films), followed by Ken Loach (27)
Dr Ball said a change in the law helped increase the number of women involved in the television industry 30 years ago.
""The passing of the Anti-Discrimination Act in 1975 and subsequent waves of legislation, coupled with the liberalising social movements of the 60s and 70s, have opened up opportunities for some women in film, TV and beyond.
""While there has been increased visibility of high-profile writers and directors such as Andrea Arnold and Sally Wainwright, such figures still remain the exception to the rule.
Dame Angela Lansbury agreed that television had given women more opportunities than film.
She said the situation was ""unfortunate"" but hoped she helped pave the way for other women after playing detective Jessica Fletcher in 12 series of Murder, She Wrote.
The programme, which started in 1984, spanned 12 series, and Dame Angela said: ""The fact that it was so successful proves that more productions with women heading up the list really would be very welcome,
""Murder, She Wrote was all about a woman who was doing a man's job as a detective and solver of crime.""
What's your favourite film genre?
Alida Valli and Joseph Cotton starred in 1949 British drama The Third Man
There are 130 genres covered in the Filmography - but which have been made most in the UK over the years?
British film-making is currently undergoing a revival with 232 films released in 2015 - the largest annual number since the 1930s.
That decade was the most prolific in UK cinema history with 1,544 films released, but the current decade could beat it with 1,269 brought out already.
The figures have gone up every decade since the UK industry's nadir of the 1980s when only 468 films were made in this country.

"Celia Imrie: I feel like a cat with nine lives
Arts and entertainment reporter
Celia Imrie grabs life ""with fever"" as shown in her new film
Celia Imrie calls herself The Happy Hoofer - the same name she gave to her 2011 autobiography.
On the face of it, the reasons seem clear.
For many a year, she's brought joy through her TV
characters, most notably of course with her collaborations alongside the late Victoria Wood.
Yet for Celia, her optimistic outlook runs much deeper. It's down to her ethos for a fulfilling life, one which strengthens with each passing day.
""I'm just grabbing life, every second and every challenge. None of us knows how long we've got,"" she tells BBC News.
""I'm not being dramatic but I'm not stupid either and time's running out a bit.""
Her attitude has driven her on through difficult times. Two
put her under serious threat.
Hard to beat: Victoria Wood's Acorn Antiques with Celia Imrie playing Babs (right)
She was in Nice, where she has a house, at the time of the
And then there was the trauma of
. ""It was a terrible shock. I didn't know she was ill,"" says Celia.
""So I grab life with fever because of the things that have happened to me.
""But I don't worry too much. Sometimes I feel like a cat with nine lives.""
With verve and fearlessness is how she also approaches her still flourishing career.
Hot on the heels of The Exotic Marigold Hotel and Absolutely Fabulous films, she's now starring in Stepping Out. And there's a new book, Sail Away - her third in three years.
Fittingly, the message of Stepping Out, and her books, is firmly one of Carpe Diem [live for the day] - whatever your age.
Judi Dench and Celia Imrie starred in The Exotic Marigold Hotel and its sequel
Stepping Out is a light - not split-your-sides - comedy in which Celia plays the bohemian single sister Bif to Imelda Staunton's stuck-up, wealthy married Sandra.
Despite having distanced herself from Bif, Sandra falls on her doorstep on discovering her husband is having an affair.
Sandra moves in with Bif and undergoes a renaissance as she, reluctantly, enters Bif's unconventional world. It's one of spontaneity, romance, true friends - and dance.
The moves are complicated stuff and even Celia, with a background in ballet, says she found the routines tough.
Celia believes changing for the better, as with Sandra, is always possible. In fact, it's vital if the status quo is ruining your life.
Stepping Out sees Imelda Staunton's stuck-up Sandra (right) charmed by sister Bif's relaxed life
""Sandra's conventional life didn't give her much joy. It only came when she left. That's a terrible realisation to make, that you've wasted so much of your time,"" says Celia.
""Change is difficult. People are afraid of it but I am optimistic people are becoming braver and not putting themselves in boxes.
""As Bette Davis wrote, 'never rely on someone else for your happiness'.""
The film is built on camaraderie, on and off-screen. The cast including Staunton, Joanna Lumley and Timothy Spall, are actors Celia knows and loves well.
They may all be of a certain age, but it's never mentioned in Stepping Out, even if it touches on the issues of loneliness and illness.
""I never thought I'd get to this age. It seemed so far away,"" says Celia. ""I thought I'd be going on coach trips and wearing white cardigans!
The dancing in the film is impressive
""But there's an awful lot open to us now and the less you talk about age the better.""
Old is not a word you'd associate with Celia. She seems timeless. Casting directors certainly seem to think so and continue to give her sensual roles.
And among Bif's very likeable characteristics, lustiness ranks high, along with a courage that, at times, defies belief. Take, for example, swimming on Hampstead Heath in sub-zero mid-winter.
""Bif is great and I'm told she was written for me, which is a lovely compliment,"" says Celia.
""On film you're battling as a woman to still be desirable. But even that's changing. People are more accepting of being 'sexy at 60'.
""As for the swim, it was totally awful. Sooo cold. I haven't been back.""
And the many doors open to older, adventurous women is central to both Stepping Out and Celia's three
Essentially mystery novels, all are rollicking, inventive reads.
The first two - Nice and Nice Work (If You Can Get It) - revolve around the cheesed off Theresa, who up sticks to the South of France. It's idyllic, yes, but, as she discovers, also a tangled web of expat intrigue.
For Sail Away, Celia has shifted the fun aboard a cross-Atlantic ship. The move was largely out of respect for the victims of the Nice attack. ""It was all too sad,"" says Celia.
Amanda and Suzy, travelling separately but both almost unwitting passengers, find themselves caught up in world of colourful characters and weird goings-on.
Celia's stories draw on experiences in her own life, not unusually perhaps. With her bought-on-a-whim Nice home, where she does her writing, Celia knows Theresa's surroundings well.
And when travelling to the US, the Queen Mary 2 is her mode of choice. It's partly down to her hatred of heights but also the risk to her lungs.
Joanna Lumley sports a rather disconcerting wig in Stepping Out
And, adds Celia: ""It's fabulous and you wouldn't believe how enormous it is. And it's not a conventional cruise. There's no stops along the way.""
Moreover each protagonist bears character traits identifiably Celia's own.
Among them, the fortitude to face the unknown - and being single. (Celia has always shunned marriage and its potential ""shackles"".)
Celia says of her openness: ""Judi Dench would be cross if she heard me saying this, but she taught me that in any performance you have to give and show parts of yourself, bear your soul.""
As for the novels' entertaining supporting cast, none is uniquely recognisable as a character Celia's met in her acting career, she says. Instead, each is a pick-and-mix of several, thrown into individual bags.
But, she adds, it's the everyday people she sees and meets when out in Nice who provide the greater inspiration.
For all that, Celia says she finds writing pretty hard. It was never something she'd considered until her autobiography publisher set her the challenge. She couldn't refuse.
So, is there anything she wouldn't do?
Can Celia Imrie play a baddie? We'll see
""I'd skedaddle out of Strictly, even though I'm always dancing around my kitchen,"" she laughs.
""I don't have good legs or ankles. You need to, to wear those dresses.
""And I definitely wouldn't do I'm A Celebrity. I'm not going to eat those things!""
Instead, the next test on the horizon is how she'll fare when her young actor son Angus (the no-strings-attached child she had with a friend) leaves home.
""He's off to be a big movie star, I'm terribly proud,"" says Celia.
And then there's the ultimate challenge, one she's craved for years.
""The sound of people laughing is bliss,"" she says, ""but I want to keep surprising people so I've just done my first horror film called Malevolent.
""At last I get to play a murderer. So everyone, watch out!""
Sail Away hits bookshelves on 22 February and Finding Your Feet will be in cinemas from 23 February.

"Kim Kardashian West: Not carrying my own child was 'so hard'
Kardashian West was told there could be health risks if she got pregnant again
Kim Kardashian West has said that not carrying her third child herself was ""so hard"", but that ""the connection with our baby came instantly"".
The reality TV star and businesswoman's third baby with Kanye West was delivered by surrogate on Monday.
""It's as if she was with us the whole time,"" she added in a post to her fans on Thursday.
Kardashian West was advised against getting pregnant again because of possible medical complications.
She carried her older two children, four-year-old daughter North and two-year-old son Saint, herself.
But she suffered from pre-eclampsia and placenta accreta on those occasions.
Pre-eclampsia is a condition that usually occurs in the second half of pregnancy and can cause serious complications if not monitored and treated.
Placenta accreta is when the placenta attaches itself too deeply into the wall of the uterus.
Kardashian West's daughter North was born in 2013
Kardashian West said in a post on her app that ""doctors said that it wasn't safe for my, or the baby's, health to carry my own"".
The 37-year-old said she and her husband decided to use a ""gestational carrier"", meaning the baby is ""biologically mine and Kanye's"".
She wrote: ""Having a gestational carrier is definitely different, but anyone who says or thinks it's the easy way out is completely wrong.
""People assume it's better because you don't have to deal with the physical changes, pain or complications with delivery, but for me it was so hard to not carry my own child, especially after I carried North and Saint.""
Kardashian West's surrogate was discussed on her reality show Keeping up with the Kardashians, but her identity was not revealed.
The star said she had a ""great"" relationship with the surrogate, and ""trusted her completely throughout the entire process"".
She added: ""I'm so grateful for modern technology and that this is even possible. It's not for everyone, but I absolutely love my gestational carrier and this was the best experience I've ever had.
""Having a gestational carrier was so special for us and she made our dreams of expanding our family come true.""
The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star announced that her daughter was born at 12.47am on Monday and weighed 7lb 6oz.
She has not yet revealed the baby's name.

Kim Kardashian's brother Rob has had his Instagram account suspended after posting explicit photos of his ex-fiancée Blac Chyna.
He also claimed she'd sent him a video of her cheating with another man.
He wrote: ""Today Chyna sent me a video after I just bought her 250K of jewellery. She sends me this video... of another man in our bed.""

Rob Kardashian also made a series of other claims about Blac Chyna before having his Instagram account taken down.
He accused her of taking drugs and having plastic surgery after the birth of Dream last November.
Blac, a model and former stripper, responded to the allegations with a Snapchat post, which has since been deleted.
Blac Chyna also has a child, King Cairo Stevenson, with rapper Tyga
It said: ""Rob u did all this but u beat me up and try act it never happen !!!!! U put hand on me I swear on god !!!!! On my kids but I'm supposed to be quiet because you're a Kardashian.""

He reposted the video he claims Blac Chyna sent to him.
He also repeated the claims that he'd paid for her to have plastic surgery after the birth of their daughter.
Rob Kardashian also claims that Blac Chyna repeatedly cheated on him and only had a baby to make him angry.
Blac Chyna's lawyer, Walter Mosley, told

""They've mainly been cheap ones. We want some designer ones. Gucci.""
She almost won Finnish Idol
Alma on Finland's Idols in 2013
As a teenager, Alma made the final of Finland's version of The X Factor - but it wasn't the best experience.
""It was 50/50, you know?"" says the singer. ""People didn't like me there because I was always trying to do things my own way.
Still, the singer made one important ally. Rapper Sini Sabotage was one of the judges, and invited Alma to tour with her after the show ended in 2013.
""We were touring Finland and doing teenage stuff and it was very much fun. But after three years, I was like, 'OK, now I need to focus on my own thing' and I started writing more.""
Would she recommend the talent show route to other aspiring singers?
""I'm not the biggest fan of those programmes,"" she says. ""They're not real. But it helped me to get to know Finnish producers and stuff like this.""
Pop stardom was never one of her goals
""I've always been making music,"" says Alma, ""but I've never, like, gone, 'I want to be a
""Writing and singing just made me feel better.""
In fact, before auditioning for Idol, she'd never considered that a career in pop was feasible.
""In Finland you can't dream about those things because it never happens to anyone,"" she says. ""We don't have any big stars in Finland so it seems unreachable.
""So now I feel very grateful every day - just overwhelmed. How did I get here?""
Her twin sister inspired her punk style
Alma and her sister share a moment before going on stage
""These are vintage, cheap clothes,"" says Alma, indicating her black t-shirt and leather jacket. ""I don't know how to buy expensive stuff.""
But it's her neon yellow hair that really makes her stand out. The singer says it was her twin sister Anna (who sings in her band) that convinced her to go day-glo.
""She did it first,"" she laughs. ""I was like, 'You can't do it, it's going to be horrible!'
""And then she walks out from the bathroom and I'm like, 'Damn! I need to do it also'. I thought it was so cool.""
The unconventional colouring also inspired a song, Dye My Hair, in which she tells her partner, ""I will dye my hair blonde for you"".

""Someone said, 'Hey, we should write a love song'. And I was like [
""I didn't want to write any cheesy lyrics - but we were listening to that Bruno Mars song, 'I would catch a grenade for you,' and I started singing, 'I would dye my hair blonde for you'.
It's that idea that, when you're in love and you go crazy, and you'd do anything for someone. But dyeing my hair blonde would be a disaster.""
Elton John championed her on his radio show
Sir Elton sent Alma a message of support after playing her music on Beats 1
""I think a lot of pop music should be called poop music,"" said Sir Elton after playing Alma's Chasing Highs on his Beats 1 show.
""But that is a great pop record, and I love it.""
The star's endorsement marked a major turning point for the singer.
""That's the point where my mum and dad said, 'OK, now we believe in you',"" she says.
""If a legend like Elton John says something like that, it's a big thing.""
Charli XCX featured Alma on her recent mixtape, Pop 2
""She's amazing,"" says Alma of the British singer - who co-wrote her new single, Dance For Me, and directed the video for Phases.
""It's hard to find people in this industry who you can really trust - but we can talk about anything. It's like a true friendship.""
Charli also gave the singer a piece of sisterly advice when Chasing Highs started to take off.
""She said, 'What you're doing with your sister is the most important thing',"" Alma recalls. ""'Even now you're going very fast, and very high up there, and you're going to see those stars - always keep your family close'.
""At that time, Chasing Highs was blowing up and I was getting invited to all these parties - so I think it was good advice for me to remember.
""You get so busy, you could easily go months without talking to your family and friends and, for me, that's not healthy.""
She's got that Hel-sinking feeling
The singer wants her album to reflect her upbringing in Finland and Lapland
Alma might be recording her debut album with Charli XCX and Justin Tranter (he's written for Justin Bieber, Linkin Park and Selena Gomez among others) but rather than fly out to work with them in LA or London, she's insisting they come to her house in Helsinki.
""That was a big thing for me,"" she explains.
""I said to my managers, 'I'm going to go home', and I wrote for two weeks in my garage, where I have a studio and where I started everything.
""I don't want the whole album to be, 'I'm in a plane and I'm at a cool party'. I want it to be about my friends, what I do in Finland, my local bars and memories. Who I love, who I'm angry with and why I'm sad.
""All the stories need to be about me and my culture,"" she adds. ""Because it's a weird culture.""
Alma's Heavy Rules mixtape is out now.

"Nasa's New Horizons probe strikes distant gold
BBC Science Correspondent, New Orleans
Artwork: The moonlet may be about 200-300km from the main object
The American space agency's New Horizons mission has struck gold again.
in 2015, scientists have just discovered that the probe's next target is not one object but very likely two.
Earth-based observations suggest the small icy world, referred to simply as MU69, has a moonlet.
will now be making a two-for-the price-of-one flyby when it has its encounter on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, 2019.
The plan is for the spacecraft to pass the 30-40km-wide main object with a separation of just 3,350km, acquiring high-resolution pictures and other data.
This should reveal new information on the Kuiper Belt - the band of distant, frozen material that orbits far from the Sun. On flyby day, New Horizons and MU69 will be some 6.5 billion km (4.5 billion miles) from Earth.
""Besides being the farthest exploration in the history of humankind, this flyby is also going to the most primitive and pristine object ever explored,"" said Prof Alan Stern, the principal investigator on New Horizons.
""We've really never been to anything like this. Of course, we've had lots of missions to comets that come from the Kuiper Belt, but they've come down into the inner Solar System where they're processed, sometimes through hundreds of passages by the Sun, and they're much smaller.
""If you remember Rosetta's comet, 67P, which you saw so many pictures of from that great Esa/Nasa mission - this is a much larger target. It could fit about a thousand Rosetta comets inside itself.""
Prof Stern was giving an update on preparations for the MU69 encounter here at the
Scientists have considered the possible shapes of the main MU69 object
His team described efforts earlier this year to tie down details about the target object's precise movement and size using occultation.
This involves making observations of MU69 as it passes in front of a far-off star.
The tell-tale details are in the way the star blinks.
What emerged from the studies was fascinating. Not only does it seem there is an accompanying moonlet perhaps 200-300km from MU69, but the main target itself may also actually be a double act - either two individual units with a small gap between them; or just touching, something called a contact binary.
""This is very exciting. This is going to have a lot of surprises,"" said New Horizons science team-member Dr Marc Buie, of the Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado.
""We think this is probably a sign that the object itself was not a collision fragment; we think it was made this way. And so we really are going to see something that dates back to the birth of our Solar System.""
After seeing Pluto disappear in the rearview mirror, Alan Stern looks towards MU69
The flyby campaign begins in earnest in August, when the first course corrections that may be required for New Horizons will be made.
Observations will also take place to ensure there are no hazards in the vicinity of MU69 that might necessitate a wider pass.
The serious business of the flyby occurs over a nine-day period starting on 25 December, 2018.
New Horizons will focus on the Kuiper Belt object, hoping to return images that have a best resolution of about 30m per pixel.
The first of these should come back to Earth a couple of days after closest approach, which currently is timed to occur at 05:33 GMT on 1 January, 2019.
""Using New Horizons' suite of seven instruments, we'll be characterising the geology and morphology of the surface, looking to see whether there are any craters. We certainly expect to see craters,"" explained team member Dr Anne Verbiscer from the University of Virginia.
""Possibly there could be grooves. We'll also map the surface composition, searching for possible ices as we saw on Pluto.
""We also want to know what makes MU69 so dark and red. And we'll be searching for satellites and rings and asking if that moon is really there; and are there any others?""

Eric Bolling suspended from Fox News amid lewd texting scandal
by Jackie Wattles and Brian Stelter
August 5, 2017: 6:11 PM ET
Fox News in a post-Ailes era
Fox News said Saturday that host Eric Bolling will be suspended from air ""pending the results of an investigation"" into whether he sent lewd photos to co-workers, a network spokesperson confirmed to CNNMoney.
The show Bolling typically hosts on Saturdays, ""Cashin' In,"" did not air.
News of the suspension came one day after
published a story saying more than a dozen sources confirmed that Bolling had sent female colleagues an ""unsolicited"" photo of his genitals.
Bolling has been one of President Trump's staunchest backers on television, and his career has benefited from it.
Bolling was a co-host of ""The Five,"" Fox's weekday roundtable, and when ""The Five"" was moved to 9 p.m. in the spring, Bolling stayed out at 5 p.m. as the leader of a new show called ""The Specialists.""
Related: Confusion, anger inside Fox News over lack of answers in network's Seth Rich probe
On the talk show Bolling sits in the center, with co-hosts Eboni Williams and Kat Timpf on either side of him, plus two guests.
Bolling frequently defends the president and ridicules opponents. He is the author of a book titled ""The Swamp,"" which earned a supportive retweet from President Trump when it was released.
The HuffPost reporter who broke the story, Yashar Ali, said he worked on it for three months and reached ""14 sources in and out of Fox News and Fox Business.""
""We were just informed of this late Friday afternoon via a HuffPost inquiry and plan to investigate the matter,"" Fox News told HuffPost.
Bolling's attorney told Ali that ""Mr. Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications, does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made."" CNNMoney's attempt to reach Bolling and his attorney Michael Bowe for comment were not immediately successful.
Bolling had already taped his Saturday morning show ""Cashin' In"" when the story came out. Fox decided late Friday to yank the taped show from its schedule. The network aired a newscast in its place.
""Cashin' In"" will continue on with substitute hosts.
Related: One year after Roger Ailes' departure, Fox News thrives as an unabashed Trump booster
It's been just over a year since former Fox host Gretchen Carlson sent shock waves through the network by suing then-CEO Roger Ailes. She accused him of firing her after she refused his ""sexual advances.""
Others at Fox News later came forward with similar claims, and Ailes left the company on July 21, 2016.
Reports also began surfacing last fall that more sexual harassment allegations were being aimed at longtime Fox News star Bill O'Reilly. O'Reilly consistently denied the allegations, but was eventually fired from the network.
A host on Fox Business, Charles Payne, was suspended last month amid a harassment investigation. He has not yet returned to work. Payne denied the allegations and called them an ""ugly lie.""
All of these cases have provoked uncomfortable questions about Fox's corporate culture and about whether management tolerated improper behavior for many years.
21st Century Fox says it has made sweeping changes to its human resources practices as a result of the Ailes scandal. The allegations involving Payne and Bolling date back to before Ailes resigned.
Fox's statement about Bolling on Saturday indicated that he may return once the investigation is complete.
--CNNMoney's Oliver Darcy contributed to this report.

"The new port trying to fulfil our shopping obsession
Business reporter, BBC News
DP World London Gateway opened in November 2013
Just five years ago, DP World London Gateway was still being dredged from the Thames. Now the UK's newest port is trying to lure the world's biggest ships to its quayside to get us our shopping quicker.
You browse online, click on something you fancy, and lo and behold often as little as 24 hours later it's on your front door step.
This seemingly magical process - a relatively recent phenomenon - is being made possible by one of the oldest industries on the planet - shipping.
Most of us don't spend a lot of time thinking about how what we buy gets to us. Yet most of the clothes you wear, much of the food you eat, the TV you watch, your phone and even the materials for the house you live in will have come to you via a ship.
""You can put anything in a box more or less,"" quips James Leeson, head of port commercial, at DP World London Gateway.
The boxes here mostly contain frozen foods such as chicken and beef, and fruit such as bananas. Occasionally they may contain the lifelong belongings of a family moving overseas, expensive cars, or even, as was the case recently, Virgin founder Richard Branson's yacht.
The port officially opened for business just four years ago.
Most of what we buy arrives by ship
The windswept, vast space has literally redrawn the Essex landscape. Situated 20 miles down the River Thames from London, in Thurrock, Essex, the port sits on a bed of sand and silt dredged from the Thames on the site of a former oil refinery.
The £1.5bn construction saw a staggering 350,000 animals moved off site into new habitats. At one stage DP World's office building on the site homed tanks of great crested newts before they were moved into newly created ponds.
It was planned long before the financial crisis when the world economy was booming and ports were struggling to handle the sheer volumes of goods coming in.
The two busiest container ports in the south east are Hutchison Whampoa's Felixstowe, in Suffolk, and DP World's other port in Southampton.
And so far the number of containers London Gateway has handled in its short existence has been dwarfed by its rivals.
Last year, Felixstowe handled almost six times as many containers as London Gateway. Even London Gateway's smaller neighbour Forth Ports-owned Tilbury handled slightly more containers.
Most of the port's processes are automated
Mr Leeson is undeterred - saying the company is in it for the long term.
""It takes a bit of time to get moving. Shipping volumes are up and we've got big names signing up to leases in logistics park,"" he says.
The port's deep channels means it can handle the latest biggest ships, the so called Neo-Panamaxes. These giants, equivalent to the width and length of three football pitches laid end to end, are increasingly the way goods are shipped.
Its other big advantage is that most of the port's operations are automated. In a space which is twice the size of the City of London just 500 people are employed.
This means faster ""frictionless trade"", says Mr Leeson. It is this that London Gateway believes will help it to gain more customers.
Incoming trucks have to pre-register and are scanned on arrival, before being sent to a specific bay where an automated crane removes or adds their container, meaning they can be in and out in half an hour.
The containers themselves are organised by huge cranes which stalk the landscape like Star Wars At-Ats. Like an oversized game of Jenga, where each container goes is carefully organised to make sure that the boxes which need to unloaded or loaded first are near the top.
A sophisticated computer system continually tracks where the containers are in the port.
Mr Leeson says this is crucial.
""It used to be that your box would arrive at port and you'd have no clue what happened. Now you can track it through port and see when it's ready for collection. Consumers are more and more demanding and we had to respond to that,"" he says.
Containers are continually tracked
But it is the scale of its logistics park which DP World is betting on to be London Gateway's biggest lure.
Currently most of the goods imported into the UK are taken by road, and some by rail, to big distribution centres in the Midlands, the traditional logistics hub for the country.
This means shipped goods are often driven from the south, up north to be packaged or priced, and then driven back to the south where the majority of items are bought and sold.
DP World believes the space it is offering will enable firms to process goods immediately after arrival, speeding up their deliveries to shops and to consumers increasingly used to Amazon Prime's 24-hour delivery promise.
Environmentally it will cut carbon emissions, but crucially DP World also expects it to cut costs.
Consumers increasingly expect goods to arrive within 24 hours
So far, parcel giant UPS and discount supermarket Lidl have taken space, with Dixons Carphone also reported to soon be opening up a warehouse.
And fruit importer SH Pratt Group is getting ready to build a giant refrigerated facility for its new venture Halo, which will package chilled and frozen goods.
Currently, the space is a muddy patch of wasteland, but Halo's managing director Gavin Knight says it will be up and running by next summer.
He says the decision to choose London Gateway was ""quite simple"".
""As soon as you put a container on wheels it adds cost. [This way] we're saving time, food miles and money,"" he says.
More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:
But Neil Davidson, shipping consultancy Drewry's senior analyst for ports and terminals, says firms will have to weigh up the advantages against the potentially higher cost of renting space and hiring staff in the south east.
With the shipping market growing ""steadily but not hugely"", the only way for London Gateway to succeed will be to steal market share from its local rivals, Mr Davidson says.
It's something that London Gateway has already started to do, albeit on a small scale.
But Mr Leeson is confident its growth will continue,
""We built London Gateway as a future proof model for future trade,"" he says.
And its other big advantage as Brexit looms is that 99% of its trade comes from outside the EU.
""We are confident that whatever happens we will see an upturn in trade,"" he says.

"Norway to boost protection of Arctic seed vault from climate change
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault took 12 months to build and opened in February 2008
Norway is to boost the flood defences of its Global Seed Vault on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard after water entered the entrance tunnel last year.
The storage facility, deep inside a mountain, is designed to preserve the world's crops from future disasters.
Unseasonably high temperatures last year caused the permafrost to melt, sending water into the access tunnel.
No seeds were damaged but the facility is to have new waterproof walls in the tunnel and drainage ditches outside.
The vault stores seeds from 5,000 crop species from around the world. Dried and frozen, it is believed they can be preserved for hundreds of years.
Although most countries keep their own supplies of key varieties, the Global Seed Vault acts as a back-up.
The forbidding entrance to the Global Seed Vault on the Arctic island of Svalbard
If a nation's seeds are lost as a result of a natural disaster or a man-made catastrophe, the specimens stored in the Arctic could be used to regenerate them.
Scientists at the facility describe the vault as the most important room in the world.
Government spokeswoman Hege Njaa Aschim told the BBC that the reason the vault was built on Svalbard was because the permafrost was thought to be permanent.
She said the problems emerged last October when the temperatures, instead of being -10C or colder, were hovering around 0C.
""It was like a wet summer in Norway,"" she told the BBC.
(C) British Broadcasting Corporation
""Inside the mountain it's safe but the problems we have experienced are just outside and in the front of the tunnel, which is the entrance. So Yes, maybe something has changed in the permafrost, but we don't know, and that is what the climate researchers are looking into. We have to follow them carefully.""
include drainage ditches on the mountainside to stop water from accumulating around the access tunnel.
Waterproof walls inside the tunnel itself will provide extra protection for the vaults themselves.
In addition, Statsbygg, the agency that administers the vault, is to carry out a research and development project to monitor the permafrost on Svalbard.

"Channel 4 show about Muslims accused of 'brownface'
My Week as a Muslim follows a family in Manchester
Channel 4 is facing criticism for dressing a white woman as a Pakistani Muslim for a new documentary.
My Week as a Muslim sees her integrated into a Manchester family after May's terrorist attack in the city.
Katie Freeman, an NHS healthcare assistant with professed anti-Muslim views, is made-over with prosthetics, brown skin and a hijab.
Fozia Khan, the show's producer, said it was designed to show what it's like to be a Muslim in Britain.
""The programme allowed Katie to meaningfully walk in the shoes of someone from a different background,"" she said.
According to Khan, it enabled Freeman ""to experience what it is like to be part of the British Pakistani Muslim community rather than observe it as an outsider.""

Freeman spent the week with the family of British-Pakistani Saima Alvi, a teacher and mother of five.

"Katie Price urging MPs to tackle online abuse
Katie Price: “He can’t speak to defend himself, I can”
Katie Price is appearing in Parliament to call on MPs to make online abuse a criminal offence.
The reality TV star and model also wants to see the creation of a register of offenders.
Her 15-year-old son Harvey - who is partially blind, autistic and has Prader-Willi syndrome - has been targeted on social media.
MPs launched an inquiry into online abuse after a petition started by Ms Price was backed by 200,000 people.
Ms Price, who is appearing alongside her mother Amy, told the Commons petitions committee people found Harvey ""an easy target"" and he could not speak up for himself.
It is possible to prosecute people who send abusive or threatening messages on social media under existing laws.
But campaigners say these laws were created before the internet was invented and need to be updated.
Ms Price says she wants to introduce legislation called Harvey's Law to give people extra protection.
She said of her son's experiences: ""Harvey was getting racial abuse, they were mocking him ... putting him on t-shirts, and he's got complex special needs - I've got five children but they always pick on him.""
""He cannot speak for himself but I can,"" she told the BBC's Daily Politics.

""I have two had people arrested by the police - they took it as far as they could but they could not charge them with anything because there is absolutely nothing in place.
""So I thought, I am going to do something about this.""
She said freedom of speech was important but there had to be a line and it was not just people with disabilities who needed protection, ""it could be anyone"".
""I am going to fight as much as I can to get online abuse a criminal offence,"" she said and added that she was counting on MPs to ""put a case together, and believe in me, and take it to the next step so it is a discussion in government"".
The Petitions Committee is looking at the impact of online abuse - particularly on people with disabilities - responsibility for protection, whether technology companies are doing enough.
It is also examining whether the law needs to be changed, how to define online abuse and what support is given to victims.

It comes as Prime Minister Theresa May also announced proposed new laws to stop people being intimidated in public life.
In a speech marking the centenary of women getting the vote, she made an appeal for ""tolerance and respect"" and said it was unacceptable for anyone to face threats over their political views.
The PM added add that she was considering a new offence to protect politicians and their families.

"Pineapples banned by Reading and Leeds Festivals
When the group performed at Glastonbury in June the stage was decorated with pineapples
Pineapples have appeared on a list of items banned from this year's Reading and Leeds Festivals, alongside fireworks and weapons.
Organisers said it was because fans of Oxford band Glass Animals bring hundreds of the fruit to their gigs, in a nod to song Pork Soda which includes the lyrics ""pineapples are in my head"".
Drummer Joe Seaward said it would be a ""challenge"" to get in with pineapples.

Frontman Dave Bayley said he overheard a conversation once between a homeless man and someone else on the street in which he thought the speaker said: ""Pineapples are in my head.""

"GP's call to 'equally protect' boys with HPV vaccine
Kirsty Bonney says she believes the vaccine should be available to all adolescents
A mum-of-two is calling for boys to receive a vaccine currently only given to girls to protect against cancer.
The Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) jab is offered to teenage girls in the UK to protect against cervical cancer.
A health committee will meet later to review whether boys should also be given the jab, which can protect against throat and penile cancers.
GP Kirsty Bonney paid privately for sons Zak, 13 and Finn, 11 to be immunised.
The doctor from Devon said she made the decision after working on a chemotherapy unit where she looked after two young men with HPV-related throat cancers.
She said she wants to see boys ""equally protected"" with the HPV vaccine rather than risk cancer in later life.
""I could never really understand why we weren't vaccinating boys and then I discovered we could have it done privately.
""I'd be much happier knowing all the boys' friends were equally protected.
""I wouldn't want to be seeing one of their friends in my surgery in a few years time [with cancer] because they hadn't been vaccinated.
""[The jab] is certainly not cheap [at £540] but the cost of that compared to the thought of them getting a throat cancer puts it into perspective.""
Australia, USA, Italy and Canada are among the countries that recommend vaccinating girls and boys
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advises UK health departments on immunisation and is considering extending the programme to include boys.
It said there was increasing evidence on links between HPV infection and other cancers.
It will discuss the matter at a meeting later and has asked Public Health England to look at the cost effectiveness of such a change.
Why should boys be vaccinated against HPV?
About 15% of UK girls eligible for vaccination are currently not receiving both doses, a figure which is much higher in some areas
Men may have sex with women too old to have had the HPV vaccination
Men may have sex with women from other countries with no vaccination programme
Men who have sex with men are not protected by the girls' programme
The cost of treating HPV-related diseases is high - the cost of treating anogenital warts alone in the UK is an estimated £58.44 million a year, while the additional cost of vaccinating boys has been estimated at about £20 million a year
Gary Tanner from Somerset, was diagnosed with HPV-related throat cancer in 2013.
He has undergone chemotherapy, radiotherapy and had his voice box removed. The 64-year-old said vaccinating girls alone made no sense.
""I am still living with cancer and most certainly my wife and I are living with the fear of cancer. We know it has shortened my life expectancy.
""There are vaccines available to prevent to protect people against this. I think they should be used on all available members of the public.""
Infection with HPV is the cause of almost all cervical cancers.
However there are more than 100 different types of HPV and infection with other types of the virus may cause:
vaginal cancer or vulval cancer
anal cancer or cancer of the penis
some cancers of the head and neck
laryngeal papillomas (warts on the voice box or vocal cords)
Campaign group HPV Action said it was ""unfair that females should be expected to bear sole responsibility for tackling an infection that affects both sexes similarly"".
, it said ""significant"" numbers of men will have sex with unvaccinated women.
""While private vaccinations can protect individual boys, this is not a solution for the male population as a whole,"" a spokesman added.
Public Health England's head of immunisation Dr Mary Ramsay said boys are already protected, with around 85% of eligible girls fully immunised.
She said: ""This helps to prevent the spread of the disease in girls and boys.""

"Growing number of MPs under scrutiny over conduct claims
A growing number of MPs are being investigated over allegations about their past conduct towards women.
Ex-ministers Daniel Poulter and Stephen Crabb are the latest Tory MPs to be referred to internal party inquiries.
One cabinet minister, Sir Michael Fallon, has already resigned while others have denied claims against them and remain in office.
Labour has suspended two MPs and is separately investigating an ex-official's allegation of rape.
The parties have begun a series of investigations under newly constituted procedures into alleged inappropriate behaviour in response to a series of press reports in the last week.
Other cases have been referred to the Cabinet Office and, in one case so far, to the police.
The First Secretary of State, who is Theresa May's effective deputy, is being investigated by the Cabinet Office over claims he ""fleetingly"" touched a female journalist's knee during a meeting in a pub in 2015 and a year later sent her a ""suggestive"" text message after she was pictured wearing a corset in a newspaper.

The ex-police officer who led the inquiry, Bob Quick, has said he will co-operate with the Cabinet Office probe.
Mr Green said the allegations were ""false"", describing them as ""disreputable political smears"" and ""amount to little more than an unscrupulous character assassination"".
has been suspended by his party after ""serious allegations"" against him were referred to the police. He says he is not aware of what the alleged claims are and denies any wrongdoing.
is being investigated by the Cabinet Office for a potential breach of ministerial rules after he admitted asking his secretary to buy sex toys. The MP for Wyre Forest also confirmed he called her ""sugar tits"", but said it did not amount to harassment.
The MP, who represents Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, has been referred to the Conservative Party disciplinary committee after allegations in the Sunday Times.
He said he ""denied all allegations of misconduct or inappropriate behaviour and will vigorously defend himself against any such claims"".

It followed a claim that he put his hand on female journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer's knee back in 2003.
After his resignation, other claims have since emerged about his conduct, with journalist Jane Merrick disclosing that he tried to kiss her following a lunch in 2003.
the leader of the House of Commons, is reported to have complained to Downing Street about ""lewd"" comments that Sir Michael is alleged to have made, which he denies, while they were both members of the Treasury select committee.
After he quit, Sir Michael - who is not under formal investigation - told the BBC that behaviour which had been ""acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now"".
The BBC understands Sir Michael did not feel that he could necessarily account for every encounter in a long ministerial career without being able to guarantee no more revelations would emerge.

has been suspended after Labour activist Ava Etemadzadeh, 27, said he sent her inappropriate text messages and made inappropriate physical contact at a student event in 2014.
He says he ""absolutely and categorically"" denies the claims, describing instead what he said was a ""brief, slight hug just before getting into my car"".
Labour says Mr Hopkins was informally reprimanded about his behaviour in 2015 but the party faces questions about how he was briefly promoted in 2016 to the role of shadow culture secretary.

The 35-year-old apologised to Labour MPs for online remarks between 2002 and 2004, saying he had been on a ""journey"" since then.
He has denied some more recent claims, including making offensive remarks to a woman he met on a dating app in a bar in Sheffield.
A formal complaint has been made against the Norwich South MP by a woman who says he groped her at the party's annual conference.
The former shadow defence secretary is alleged to have hugged her and squeezed her bottom. Mr Lewis is ""vigorously"" disputing the allegation, telling the BBC ""it's just not how I roll, it's not what I do"".
He suggested the encounter may have been ""misinterpreted"" and he would never have ""deliberately"" done what was alleged.

Ms Bailey, who was 19 at the time, said she had been told reporting the matter might ""damage"" her career.
Labour's response to the incident, which did not involve an MP, is the subject of an investigation by the QC Karon Monaghan.
The MSP said she was sexually assaulted by a senior male colleague at a party in 2013.

"Managing the managers: The rise of the business 'philosopher-kings'
BBC World Service, 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy
Are the new ideas and approaches pioneered by management consultants worth their fees?
The place: a textile plant near Mumbai, India. The time: 2008. The scene? Chaos.
Rubbish is piled up outside the building - with almost as much inside. There are piles of flammable junk, and open chemical containers.
The yarn is at least bundled up in white plastic bags, but the inventory is scattered around the plant in unmarked piles.
Such shambolic conditions are typical in the Indian textile industry, and that presents an opportunity.
A team of researchers from Stanford University and the World Bank is conducting a novel experiment. They're going to send in a team of management consultants to tidy up some of these companies - but not others.
Then they'll track what happens to their profits as part of a
It will tell us conclusively whether the management consultants are worth their fees.
highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live.
It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find
That question has often been raised over the years. If managers often have bad reputations, what should we make of the people who tell managers how to manage?
Picture a management consultant. What comes to mind?
A young, sharp-suited graduate, earnestly gesturing to a bulleted PowerPoint presentation that reads something like ""holistically envisioneer client-centric deliverables""?
Some management consultants are criticised for their reliance on business jargon
Okay, I got that from an online random buzzword generator. But you get the idea.
The industry battles a stereotype of charging exorbitant fees for advice that, on close inspection, turns out to be either meaningless or common sense.
Managers who bring in consultants are often accused of being blinded by jargon, implicitly admitting their own incompetence, or seeking someone else to blame for unpopular decisions.
Still, it's big business. The year after Stanford and the World Bank started their Indian study, the UK government alone spent well over $2bn (£1.5bn) on management consultants. Globally, consulting firms charge their clients a total of about $125bn (£94bn).
Where did this strange industry begin?
There's a noble way to frame its origins: economic change creates a new challenge, and visionary men of business provide a solution.
In the late 19th century the US economy was expanding fast, and thanks to the railway and telegraph it was also becoming more of a national market and less a collection of local ones.
Company owners began to realise that there were huge rewards to be had for companies that could bestride this new national stage. So began an unprecedented wave of mergers and consolidations.
Heinz, which dates back to 1869, grew substantially at the beginning of the 19th century
Companies swallowed each other up, creating giant household names: US Steel, General Electric, Heinz, AT&T.
Some employed more than 100,000 people. And that was the challenge: nobody had ever tried to manage such vast organisations before.
Enter a young professor of accountancy by the name of James McKinsey. His breakthrough was a book published in 1922, with the not-entirely-thrilling title Budgetary Control.
But for corporate America, Budgetary Control was revolutionary. Rather than using traditional historical accounts to provide a picture of how a business had been doing over the past year, McKinsey proposed drawing up accounts for an imaginary corporate future.
These future accounts would set out a business's plans and goals, broken down department by department.
And later, when the actual accounts were drawn up they could be compared to the plan, which could then be revised.
McKinsey's method helped managers take control, setting out a vision for the future rather than simply reviewing the past.
James McKinsey saw the potential of setting out a corporate vision of the future
McKinsey was a big character - tall, and fond of chomping cigars, ignoring his doctor's advice. His ideas caught on with remarkable speed: by the mid-1930s he was hiring himself out at $500 (£380) a day - about $25,000 (£19,000) in today's money.
And as his own time was limited, he took on employees. If he didn't like a report they wrote, he'd hurl it in the bin. ""I have to be diplomatic with our clients,"" he told them. ""But I don't have to be diplomatic with you bastards!""
Aged just 48, James McKinsey died of pneumonia. But under his lieutenant, Marvin Bower, McKinsey & Company thrived.
Bower was a particular man. He insisted that employees wore a dark suit, a starched white shirt, and, until the 1960s, a hat.
McKinsey & Co, he said, was not a business but a ""practice"". It didn't take on jobs, but ""engagements"". It was not a company, but a ""firm"". Eventually it simply became known as ""The Firm"".
'Business philosopher-kings'
Duff McDonald wrote a history of The Firm, arguing that its advocacy of scientific approaches to management transformed the business world.
It acquired a reputation as perhaps the world's most elite employer. The New Yorker once described McKinsey's young Ivy League hires parachuting into companies around the world as a ""Swat team of business philosopher-kings"".
But hold on. Why don't company owners simply employ managers who've studied those scientific approaches themselves? There aren't many situations where you'd hire someone to do a job, and also hire expensive consultants to advise them how to do it.
What accounts for why companies like McKinsey gained such a foothold in the economy?
Part of the explanation is surprising: government regulation. The Glass-Steagall act of 1933 was a far-reaching piece of American financial legislation.
The Glass-Steagall act - signed by Franklin Roosevelt in June 1933 - was meant to limit conflicts of interest
Among many provisions, Glass-Steagall made it compulsory for investment banks to commission independent financial research into the deals they were brokering.
Fearing conflicts of interest, Glass-Steagall forbade law firms, accountancy businesses and the banks themselves from conducting this work. Effectively, the act made it a legal requirement for banks to hire management consultants.
In 1956 the Justice Department banned the emerging computer giant IBM from providing advice about how to install or use computers. Another business opportunity for the management consultants.
Minimising conflicts of interest was a noble aim, but it hasn't always worked out well.
Some time after McKinsey's long-serving boss, Rajat Gupta, left the firm, he
, and then was paid for advising him, before quietly fading into the background while Enron collapsed and Skilling went to jail.
Here's another argument for employing management consultants: ideas on management evolve all the time, so maybe it's worth getting outsiders in periodically for a burst of fresh thinking.
But often it doesn't work like that: the consultants continually find new problems to justify their continued employment. Some use the analogy of leeches, attaching themselves and never letting go.
It's a strategy known as ""land and expand"". One UK government ministry recently admitted that 80% of its supposedly temporary consultants had been working there for more than a year - some for up to nine years.
Needless to say, it would have been much cheaper to employ them as civil servants.
No doubt the consultancy firms will claim that their expertise is giving the taxpayer value for money.
Which brings us back to India, and that randomised controlled trial.
Management consultants saw an opportunity in the often shambolic Indian textile industry
The World Bank hired a global consulting firm to put some structure into these jumbled Mumbai textile factories, instituting preventive maintenance, proper records, systematic storing of spares and inventory, and the recording of quality defects.
It worked. Productivity jumped by 17% - easily enough to pay the consulting fees.
We shouldn't conclude from this study that cynicism about management consulting is always misplaced.
These factories were, after all, what a jargon-filled PowerPoint presentation might call ""low-hanging fruit"".
But it's scientific proof of one thing, at least. As so often in life, when an idea is used simply, and humbly, it can pay dividends.

"The Beatles' Sgt Pepper comes home for 50th anniversary
Brodie Arthur will take the spirit of Sgt Pepper to terraced houses in Toxteth
It is (almost) 50 years ago today that The Beatles released Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Liverpool is celebrating the landmark album's anniversary with a festival - and one event is taking it particularly close to home for locals.
When actress Brodie Arthur was asked to take part in Liverpool's official Sgt Pepper anniversary celebrations, she first needed to do some quick research.
""When they said 'Sgt Pepper,' I said, 'Oh no, I'll have to Google it because I don't know any of the songs on the album,'"" the 25-year-old says.
""When I listened, I knew a couple of them, but I wouldn't necessarily have associated them with the album. I remember the cover and what it looks like, but I've never really been familiar with it.""
Now more familiar, Arthur is the star of a play inspired by track six, She's Leaving Home.
Listening to it afresh as someone half the age of the album itself, the stirring ballad still ""hits you in the feelers"", she says.
The Beatles were at the height of their powers when the album was released on 1 June 1967
The play is one of a number of events taking place in the Fab Four's home city for the anniversary.
Each song has inspired a different performance or artwork.
But none is what you might expect - there are no tribute gigs or homages to the LP's iconic cover.
For She's Leaving Home, Liverpool-based theatre company 20 Stories High asked young people about their home lives and their reactions to the song, which was written about a girl who walks out because she feels trapped by her parents - who say they have ""sacrificed most of our lives"" for her.
Performances will take place for audiences of just 10 people in the front rooms of terraced houses in the Toxteth area, meaning the play is more closely rooted in the city than any of the other anniversary events.
Arthur, who's from Toxteth and is a former member of 20 Stories High's youth theatre, says she can relate to the song.
Bringing the song up to date
""Even though it was 1967, it does feel like that [now], and it hit me because when I left home my mum was a bit like that - 'I've sacrificed my whole life,' and all the rest of it.
""I was just looking at it like, 'I'm 18 and I want to move out and why are you being so horrible?'
""But now when I look back and after listening to the song, I thought, 'Oh bless her, she must have been an absolute emotional wreck and I was just packing my bags and leaving her.'""
Playwright Keith Saha says he didn't just want to retell the song's original story.
""We wanted to think, what is it like in 2017? What decisions do young people have to make now when they leave home?""
For the intimate performance, Brodie delivers her monologues from the sofa, occasionally heading upstairs or out of the front door to shout at unseen characters while audience members watch from other sofas and stools.
Audience members will watch Brodie Arthur from the comfort of their, or someone else's, home
Her teenage character must make her way in the world while supporting her mum and two siblings, and we also hear about friends and their housing problems.
Many of the stories in the play come from the members of the youth theatre who shared their experiences before the script was written.
According to Saha and director Julia Samuels, they included a young pregnant woman who wasn't prioritised for council housing until her baby had been born; those having problems with private landlords; young carers; parents who sacrificed things for their children; and children who sacrificed things for their parents.
The results hit home, Arthur affirms. ""I was on Facetime with my boyfriend and I was going through the script, and him and his mum were going, 'Mate, how relevant is that? It couldn't be any more bang on.'
""My mate came round yesterday and I only went through the first eight pages and she was like, 'Girl, I can't wait to see this, I literally feel like this is me and you years ago.'
""It's real, isn't it? Or it feels it.""
First, 15 public performances will take place in a house in the Granby area, half a mile from the house where Ringo Starr grew up.
""We did think about doing it in there,"" says Samuels. ""But it was a bit small.""
After that, the play will go on a micro-tour of Liverpool 8 (the postcode area that lent its name to Starr's 2008 album), with another 15 performances in 15 homes.
The householders all applied to host Arthur and her performance, and can invite family, neighbours and friends to watch.
It really is close to home for Arthur - her auntie lives three doors down from the house that is hosting the first 15 performances, and a cousin lives over the road.
""So this is where I'm from, this is all I've ever known.""
This means she could see lots of familiar faces gazing from the sofas and stools around her.
""Obviously I'm nervous to see how many people I actually know whose houses we're going in to. But I think it just gives an extra bit of passion because some of the issues that are raised are actual issues.""
Fifty years on, Sgt Pepper is still speaking to the people of Liverpool.

"Prezzo to close 94 restaurants in rescue bid
Italian restaurant chain Prezzo plans to close about a third of its outlets in an attempt to rescue the business.
The chain, which is owned by private equity firm TPG Capital, employs about 4,500 people.
Prezzo is closing 94 restaurants - including all 33 outlets in its TexMex chain Chimichanga - leaving the firm with 208 sites.
The closures aim to repair Prezzo's financial position and allow it to continue trading.
Prezzo has entered a restructuring arrangement know as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) - a step short of going into administration.
Prezzo was bought by TPG in 2014 for just over £300m.
It is the latest of a string of High Street firms to run into difficulties. The UK arm of
both collapsed into administration this week.
Burger chain Byron and Jamie's Italian have both had to undergo similar restructurings this year, agreeing rescue plans with their lenders and landlords, and closing restaurants.
Barbecoa, a smaller chain also owned by Jamie Oliver, went into administration earlier this month.

"Carpetright shares hit as profit forecast cut
Floor coverings specialist Carpetright has said it expects full-year profits to be at the ""bottom end"" of expectations amid a ""volatile and unpredictable"" consumer market.
Its comments came as it said profits for the six months to 28 October sank to £0.3m from £4.1m last year.
The chain blamed the lack of consumer confidence, increased competition and discounting for the fall.
Shares in Carpetright dropped by 7.5% on news of the weaker profit outlook.
A softening of the housing market in some areas, pressures on consumer spending from inflation and subdued wage growth have all fed into a weaker performance.
Carpetright chief executive Wilf Walsh said: ""The first half has undoubtedly been challenging. Consumer confidence remains fragile and we continue to manage the impact of intensified competition.""
Despite the fall in half-year profits, like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of store openings and closures - rose 0.7% in the UK and 6.5% in the rest of Europe.
Mr Walsh added: ""We have made pleasing progress in our core flooring business in the UK - like-for-like sales are up, more than half the UK store estate has now been refurbished and our customer service metrics have been improved significantly.
""However, as previously flagged, our first half profits reflect the impact of the clearance of discontinued lines in our beds business and also unsuccessful deeper discounting promotions in the Netherlands and Belgium, which are now being addressed.""

"Former EastEnders actor Joseph Shade admits sex offences
Ex-EastEnders actor Joseph Shade admitted sex offences against three girls between 2012 and 2015
Former EastEnders actor Joseph Shade has admitted sexual offences against three teenage girls.
The youth worker, from Sheringham in Norfolk, played Peter Beale as a child from 1998 until 2004.
Shade, 24, admitted five counts of causing or inciting a child under 18 to engage in sexual activity while in a position of trust and one count of sexual activity with a child.
He was released on bail and will be sentenced at a later date.
The offences were committed against three girls aged between 14 and 17, and happened between 2012 and 2015, Norwich Crown Court heard.
Shade was a youth worker at a project in Norfolk at the time when he sent sexual text messages to girls and touched one on the bottom, prosecutor Chris Paxton said.
The former soap actor had been helped by the youth project himself, but ""as he reached the age of 18 he became formally employed as a youth worker... and engaged with many young people who came from similar backgrounds and vulnerabilities as he had"", Mr Paxton said.
He played the character Peter Beale (being carried, above) between 1998 and 2004
""During the course of his employment he accepts by his pleas that his relationships became too close to a number of attendees and he would engage with them by texting them messages asking them to have sex or to send sexual pictures of breasts and the like.
""On one occasion and only one occasion he touched one of them.""
Shade had no previous convictions and was ""tearful and expressed a degree of remorse"" when interviewed by police, Mr Paxton told the court.
Joseph Shade denied the charges when he first appeared in court last December
He had initially denied 11 sexual offences against four girls, but changed his plea, admitting to six counts against three of the teenagers.
The prosecution ordered the remaining five counts to lie on file.
Judge Maureen Bacon warned Shade he could face a jail sentence.
Shade is one of a number of actors who have appeared in the BBC soap playing Ian and Cindy Beale's son, Peter. The character was named after his grandfather, market stallholder Pete Beale.

"Canada nurse Elizabeth Wettlaufer jailed for life for murders
Elizabeth Wettlaufer, arrested in October last year, was described as a ""shadow of death""
A Canadian nurse who used insulin to kill eight elderly patients in Ontario care homes has been sentenced to life in prison, local media report.
Elizabeth Wettlaufer, 49, pleaded guilty earlier this month to killing five women and three men in two nursing homes between 2007 and 2014.
Wettlaufer was described by the judge on Monday as a ""shadow of death"" that passed over her victims, the
She was told she may never be released.
""I caused tremendous pain and suffering and death,"" Wettlaufer said after receiving her sentence, adding: ""Sorry is much too small a word. I am extremely sorry.""
Ontario Superior Court Justice Bruce Thomas said Wettlaufer was a ""predator"" who took the lives of those she was supposed to protect and care for during her time as a nurse, CBC reports.
Many of the victims' relatives were present in the courthouse for Wettlaufer's sentencing and were told by the judge to take their time when reading their victim impact statements.
Friends of some of the victims also gathered outside the courthouse in Woodstock, Ontario, on Monday to express their hurt and anger.
""I think she should spend the rest of her life in a small box contemplating what she's done,"" said Laura Jackson, a friend of Maurice Granat, one of the victims.
Arpad Horvath, whose father was also killed by Wettlauffer while in her care, said the former nurse's statement in court only made him angry.
""An apology like that is just a waste of time, paper and air,"" he said.
Police launched an investigation into the nursing home deaths in September.
Wettlaufer resigned from the College of Nurses of Ontario a day after that, and was arrested in October.
In January, police brought six additional charges - four counts of attempted murder and two counts of aggravated assault - against Wettlaufer for other incidents that took place in care homes between 2007-16. ​

"Minister Guy Opperman faces anger in Waspi debate
MPs have lined up to criticise the government for failing to do more to help 2.6m women who have lost out because of changes to pension law.
In a packed and rowdy debate, MPs claimed women born in the 1950s were suffering ""hardship"" and ""indignity"".
The SNP's Mhairi Black said it was ""laughable"" the problem could not be fixed when the government had found £1bn to fund its deal with the DUP.
Minister Guy Opperman said he would look at cases of financial hardship.
But he faced shouts of ""shame on you"" when he said the government was ""actually doing a significant amount"" to address the individual difficulties of older workers trying to enter the labour market - including by offering them apprenticeships.
The debate centred on the plight of the so-called Waspi women - Women Against State Pension Inequality - whose aim is to achieve fair transitional arrangements for women born in the 1950s, for whom the state pension age is being raised from 60 to 66 by 2020.
Ms Black said she had been contacted by a woman who said her friend had committed suicide after the general election result ""because she could not face what was going to happen to her"".
""Citizens committing suicide over an issue that could be solved like that - an issue the government could do a U-turn on at any given moment,"" she said.
SNP MP Mhairi Black said it would cost £8bn over five years to fix the anomaly
Ms Black said it was ""an absolute disgrace"" that a debate on the issue was having to be held again.
Turning to Mr Opperman, a pensions minister, she said it was ""laughable"" that the government ""can find a billion pounds for a deal to cling on to power, but we cannot find the money to give women the pensions that they are due"".
""The only other two things they are guilty of is being born in the 50s and the fact they are women.""
Labour's Caroline Harris said the government ""has betrayed these women - they've stolen their security and they've shattered their dreams without time to prepare and make the necessary alternative arrangements"".
Mr Opperman, setting out the government's work on ""lifelong learning"" said: ""The reality is over 200,000 people over 60 have entered further education since 2014/15.
""We have also extended apprenticeship opportunities as one of the best routes to skilled employment for people of all ages and gender.
""Such apprenticeships in England, for example, in 2014/15... 12% of the starting apprenticeships were for those aged 45.""
Mr Opperman was heckled by MPs as he outlined the details.
Labour's Graham Jones (Hyndburn), raising a point of order, said: ""I'm struggling to hear the debate, did the minister just say that women aged 64 could go on an apprenticeship course?""

"Sky profits sag as football costs rise
Business reporter, BBC News
Julia Stiles stars in the Sky Atlantic drama Riviera
Higher costs for Premier League rights have hit annual profits at Sky despite a jump in revenues and new customers.
The satellite broadcaster said total costs rose by 5%, with the £629m jump in football rights accounting for most of the increase in programming costs.
That helped send pre-tax profit down £27m to £1.05bn, while operating profit slid £87m to £1.46bn.
Revenues at Sky rose 10% to £12.9bn, while almost 700,000 new customers brought the total to 22.5 million.
While the UK and Ireland remained its biggest market, the company now has five million customers in Germany and Austria, while a new loyalty programme in Italy had been an ""outstanding success"".
A similar loyalty scheme will be launched in the UK and Ireland this autumn in a bid to cut the churn rate - the number of customers who leave - which rose from 11.2% to 11.5%. Chief executive Jeremy Darroch said the rate remained ""at a level higher than we would like"".
""We will continue to identify opportunities to reach new customers through the recently launched new portfolio of channels and pricing to drive growth in Sky Sports UK,"" he said.
George Salmon, a Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, said price increases that followed the higher Premier League football rights costs meant ""more customers are choosing to leave Sky than have done for quite some time. Clearly, this presents a problem"".
Only half the rise in revenues was due to organic growth, with the remainder due to the positive impact of currency moves, he said.
""21st Century Fox's takeover of Sky looms large over the group. Given the price is 40% above what the shares changed hands for just prior to the offer, this remains the dominant issue for shareholders,"" Mr Salmon added.
Shares in Sky fell 2p to 964.5p in morning trading in London.
Liberum analysts still expect the Fox takeover to be approved, but warned: ""If there is any concern the bid will not go through, the shares could come under pressure as investors focus more on the fundamentals.""
They said Sky won just 35,000 new customers in the UK and Ireland in the fourth quarter, a sharp drop from last year's 93,000, while average revenue per user was flat at £47 despite the price rises.
Like-for-like revenues in the UK rose 4% to £8.6bn during what Sky called a ""challenging environment"" for consumer-focused businesses and ""prevailing headwinds"" in the advertising market. It has 11.4 million TV customers in the UK, while one in four broadband customers now take ultrafast fibre.
Sky said it increased investment in original content by a quarter, with the glossy drama Riviera setting new records with two million viewers and almost 12 million downloads. All episodes of the drama, which stars Julia Stiles, Anthony LaPaglia and Adrian Lester, were made available to viewers in the same way as Netflix's successful ""box set"" approach.
The firm also plans to introduce a service similar to its NOW TV offering in Spain, which requires only a broadband connection rather than a satellite dish.

"Maria Caulfield: MP's new women's role sparks backlash
Women's right groups have criticised Theresa May's decision to appoint an MP who opposed the decriminalisation of abortion to a role representing women.
Maria Caulfield, new Conservative vice chair for women, said decriminalisation would lead to ""abortion on demand"".
Abortion provider BPAS said the PM's decision to appoint Ms Caulfield to the role was incredibly disappointing.
Sophie Walker, Women's Equality Party (WEP) leader, said Ms Caulfield could ""never advocate effectively"" for women.
The BBC has contacted Ms Caulfield - the Conservative MP for Lewes and a former nurse - for a response.
Currently, women in England and Wales have to prove to two medical professionals that carrying on with the pregnancy is detrimental to their health or wellbeing, before having a termination.
Without permission, abortion remains a criminal offence under the 1967 Abortion Act.
In March last year, a Ten Minute Rule Bill called for changes to the law, to prevent the prosecution of women who end their own pregnancies without permission.
The proposed changes would have meant women who, for example, order abortion pills online and self-administer would not risk prosecution.
saying the idea would leave young women less safe and ""embolden"" men who force women into abortion.
She said it would become a ""charter for extreme abortion practices"", including sex-selective abortion.
Ms Caulfield, a member of the all-party pro-life parliamentary group, said she feared the proposal would fuel ""unethical and unsafe"" procedures.
We are incredibly disappointed to hear that Maria Caulfield MP, who supports the criminalisation of women who end their own pregnancies, is the new CCHQ Vice Chair for Women.
End of Twitter post by @bpas1968
In a statement, BPAS (the British Pregnancy Advisory Service) said it was ""shocked"" the Conservative Party had appointed an MP ""who supports the criminalisation of women who end their own pregnancies"".
It said Ms Caulfield had been a ""leading opponent"" of the proposed bill, which did not become law and has not been reintroduced since last year's general election.
""That the new Conservative vice chair for women believes that these women should face up to life imprisonment is appalling. Maria Caulfield has stated that she wants to be a 'voice for the unborn child',"" BPAS said.
""It is profoundly disappointing that the Conservative Party did not think that a better choice for vice chair for women would be someone willing and able to speak up for the one in three women who will have an abortion in their lifetime.""
In a string of tweets, BPAS added that Ms Caulfield's views were ""out of step with members of the public and her own parliamentary party"".
Sophie Walker, of the WEP, and feminist author Judith Orr also objected to the appointment.
. Women's equality goes hand in hand with reproductive rights. Someone who believes those rights should be restricted can never advocate effectively for us.
— Sophie Walker (@SophieRunning)
End of Twitter post by @SophieRunning
So we now have in Maria Caulfield a Tory vice chair of women (or as describes it, vice ""chairman"" of women ...) who doesn't support a woman's right to control her own body. We need to defend and extend our
not allow them to be snatched back by Tory bigots.
End of Twitter post by @juditheo
Labour MP Diana Johnson, who introduced the Ten Minute Rule Bill, said it was ""really depressing"".
She accused Ms Caulfield of ""arguing for women to still be covered by Victorian laws"".
A fresh debate on the decriminalisation of abortion in England and Wales was sparked in July, when
Members at the British Medical Association's annual conference voted to scrap legislation that an abortion without permission was a criminal offence.
However, fellow Conservative MP Nadine Dorries tweeted her support for Ms Caulfield, whom she felt had been attacked for holding a ""different point of view"".
Really depressing to see that

End of Twitter post by @NadineDorries
In 2015, Ms Caulfield voted with the government opposing the removal of the so called tampon tax, currently levied on female sanitary products.
Just three Tory MPs - all men - voted in favour scrapping the tax.
Having been appointed to the position of party vice chair for women, Ms Caulfield
that on her first day in the role she had raised the issue of access to sanitary products for women in custody with the home secretary.
She said it was an ""important issue"".
Ms Caulfield's appointment is part of a major shake-up at Conservative headquarters (CCHQ), where she will now work.

"Inside The Video Archive, a Quentin Tarantino-themed speakeasy
is a small, brightly lit video store on a quiet block in Cincinnati, Ohio.
But if you're lucky enough to pull the correct B-grade horror flick tape off the shelf, the walls open up to reveal a hidden speakeasy. And not just any speakeasy -- one dedicated to the life and work of director Quentin Tarantino, who worked at a store called The Video Archive before hitting it big.
The bar is the brainchild of Jacob Trevino, a longtime Tarantino fan. ""The bar pays homage to not just his films but films that inspired his films,"" Trevino tells CNN Travel.
While speakeasies are trendy now, The Video Archive manages to feel fun and exclusive without hitting the theme too hard, meaning that non-movie buffs will have just as good a time as hardcore Tarantino fanatics.
What's on offer at The Video Archive.
The easiest place to spot the theme is on the drinks menu, which features cocktails such as the Jackie Brown (bourbon, elderflower liqueur, blackberry purée and salted honey) and the Bloody Mia (a Bloody Mary with lemon juice and celery salt on the rim).
There's also sake, wine, milkshakes and a healthy representation of beer from the Cincinnati area, including local favorite breweries MadTree and Rhinegeist.
And, of course, the menu wouldn't be complete without food -- specifically, a Royale with Cheese.
Tarantino movies play on a loop behind the bar, and there's a jukebox surrounded by photos of people dressed as Mia Wallace, the Uma Thurman character in ""Pulp Fiction"" best recognized by her black bob and crisp white button-down.
On a wall opposite the bar, a wink at Tarantino's love of violent movie sequences takes the shape of a neon ""Bang Bang"" sign on a black background.
While the bar has already become a must-visit spot for in-the-know locals and movie buffs, there's still one VIP who hasn't yet had the chance to pull a lucky VHS tape off the wall: the director himself.
""Mr. Tarantino has an open invitation at the bar that we hope he takes us up on,"" says Trevino. ""We'll have a shot of green chartreuse waiting because, as he famously said, ""green chartreuse - a liquor so good they named a color after it.""

"TalkTalk most complained-about broadband provider
Overall the trend of complaints to Ofcom is down, suggesting providers are improving their services
TalkTalk has been named as the most complained-about broadband firm in the UK, according to the latest report from regulator Ofcom.
The watchdog received nearly 250 complaints a day about communications services from July to September 2017.
The Post Office came out worst for landline services and Vodafone received most complaints from mobile users.
In response, TalkTalk said closure of customer service centres in India had been partially to blame.
""That move, and a radical shift to self serve, is already delivering a material improvement in customer satisfaction and we expect complaint data for 2018 to reduce significantly,"" the firm said in a statement, adding that it was ""disappointed"" by the figures.
TalkTalk and BT received the worst customer satisfaction scores in a survey of 12 broadband providers, conducted by Which last year.
According to Ofcom, the main sources of grumbles against TalkTalk were faults, service and provision issues. Complaint handling and billing were secondary concerns.
The industry average for complaints about broadband was 18 per 100,000 people, Ofcom said.
In the landline market the worst provider was the Post Office, with 24 complaints per 100,000 customers, although many of the issues were attributed to its takeover of Fuel Broadband, which led to problems with service provision and complaints handling.
In the mobile market, Vodafone came out worst, with 10 complaints per 100,000 customers. By contrast, BT received nine, EE, Three and O2 all had three while Tesco only recorded one.
Jane Rumble, Ofcom's director of consumer policy, said: ""We're shining a light on how different providers perform, and it's clear many need to up their game on service quality and complaints handling.
""People expect high standards from their providers and companies must put their customers first.""
Ewan Taylor-Gibson, telecoms expert at price comparison site uSwitch, said: ""If we take a longer term view, the overall trend is that complaints to Ofcom are continuing to drop, which hopefully suggests providers are improving their service delivery rather than consumers being less minded to complain.
""Having said that, there are still areas that could do with some improvement - customers are still most likely to grumble about broadband and landline services.""

"Elon Musk: The man who sent his sports car into space
Elon Musk, It Boy of Silicon Valley
The Falcon Heavy's boosters burned for 154 seconds before they jettisoned into space. Free from the main body of the rocket, they spun 180 degrees and arced back towards the earth, burning their engines again as they descended to Cape Canaveral, to land, smoothly, improbably upright, within a second of one other.
Meanwhile, the main rocket pushed on, preparing to bring the world an even less credible sight. Four minutes into the flight, the nose cone broke apart to reveal its payload: a cherry-red electric sports car, with the top down, in space - a PR stunt for the ages.
It was all brought to you by Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire entrepreneur and founder of Paypal, electric car company Tesla, and SpaceX, the manufacturer of the Falcon Heavy. The partly-reusable Heavy is the most powerful rocket on earth, and, if Mr Musk is to be believed, a stepping stone to a rocket to Mars.
The sports car in the nosecone was one of Mr Musk's own Tesla Roadsters. Its stereo was programmed to play David Bowie's Space Oddity on repeat as it travels for millions of years through space. Or until the battery dies, anyway.
""It's kind of silly and fun,"" he conceded, ""but silly and fun things are important.""
A Tesla Roadster floats in space, before heading somewhere in the direction of Mars
In the 12 years since Mr Musk sold online payments firm Paypal for $1.5bn, he has evolved in the public imagination into a kind of mad genius figure - part industrialist, part scientist, part playboy, part superhero. He has dated and married famous actresses, including Talulah Riley and Amber Heard, and had a rumoured fling with Cameron Diaz. Robert Downey Jr took inspiration from him to play Tony Stark in Iron Man.
He has cornered private space flight and the electric car industry, ventured into solar energy and artificial intelligence, and promised super-high speed magnetic train travel, in a tube, underground. Oh, and he plans to colonise Mars.
Most take Mr Musk's more wild ambitions and boasts with a galaxy-sized pinch of salt. His companies have missed deadline after deadline and recorded massive losses. But climate change campaigners have hailed the unexpected popularity of Tesla's electric cars, and the launch of the Falcon Heavy capped a string of successes for SpaceX.
Falcon Heavy: the story of the launch
It all began in Pretoria, South Africa. As a young boy, he was obsessed with science fiction novels and more or less anything you could run a current through. His parents, Maye, a model, and Errol, an engineer, separated when he was eight. His younger brother and sister would stay with their mother, so he volunteered to go with their father. It did not go well. He later recalled returning home after vicious bullying at school, ""and it would just be awful there as well"".
At 17, he moved to Canada to study physics and economics at Ontario's Queen's University. From Canada he migrated to the US in 1992, transferring to the University of Pennsylvania, and from Pennsylvania to a PhD in energy physics at Stanford in California, After two days, he quit.
Instead he founded Zip2, an online newspaper platform, with his younger brother Kimbal. In 1999 they sold the company to Compaq for $300m, and Mr Musk ploughed his share into an online bank, X.com. X.com became Paypal, and in 2002 Paypal sold to eBay for $1.5bn. Aged 31, Mr Musk netted $165m.
Falcon Heavy's booster rockets descend to land at Florida's Space Coast
By that time, Mr Musk was two years into a marriage to Justine Wilson, an aspiring fantasy writer he met in Ontario. Mr Musk asked her out for ice cream. She agreed but then blew him off. He showed up in the student centre, where she was studying, with two cups of ice cream.
""He's not a man who takes no for an answer,""
He is said to be a relentless worker. When he founded Zip2, he reportedly worked all day, slept in the office, and showered over the road at the YMCA. Asked in 2010 what advice he would give entrepreneurs, he suggested they should ""put in 80 to 100-hour weeks every week"".
""If other people are putting in 40-hour work weeks, and you're putting in 100-hour work weeks, you'll achieve in four months what takes them a year,"" he said.
As they danced at their wedding, Justine later recalled, he told her: ""I am the alpha in this relationship"". He was a controlling husband, she said, pushing her to dye her hair more and more blonde. ""I am your wife,"" she recalled saying, ""not your employee."" ""If you were my employee,"" he would reply, ""I would fire you.""
Their first son, Nevada, died at 10 weeks from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome - a tragedy that Mr Musk refused to talk about, she said. They went on to have five more children - twins and a set of triplets - via IVF, but she struggled with depression over the death of their first son.
Eight years after they married, they divorced, in a messy, multi-million dollar separation. Six weeks later, he texted her to say he was engaged to Talulah Riley, a British actress 14 years his junior.
. ""Going to sleep alone kills me.""
He and Ms Riley married in 2010. They divorced in 2012 and remarried in 2013. In 2014 he filed for, then withdrew, a second divorce and in 2016 she filed for divorce and it took.
Elon Musk and Talulah Riley arrive at the White House in February 2014
After the sale of Paypal in 2002, Mr Musk ploughed his $165m into three new companies: Tesla, SpaceX, and a solar energy company called Solar City. Tesla was a quixotic venture, a niche electric car company in a nation addicted to petrol.
With Mr Musk as CEO, the company set out a top-down plan - first, market a high-performance sports car, a machine that would set Tesla apart from a stereotype of small, underpowered electric vehicles. Then a luxury sedan, and finally a low-cost, mass-market electric car.
A $456m loan from the US government saved Tesla from near-bankruptcy in 2008, and in 2010 it became the first American car company to float on the stock market since Ford in 1956. In 2017, it surpassed Ford and General Motors to become, briefly, the most valuable car company in the country. It was the market betting on a greener future, and not a reflection of Tesla's bottom line.
Serious production delays on its low-cost Model 3 have compounded years of losses. On Wednesday, the day after its Roadster went interstellar, Tesla Inc landed with a bump. It reported a $675.4m (Â£487m) loss in the last quarter of 2017, more than five times worse than the previous year, although revenue climbed 44% to $3.3 billion.
""We were in a deeper level of hell than we expected, still a few levels deeper than we would like to be,"" said Mr Musk on a conference call with analysts. It was a characteristic take for a man preoccupied with human extinction.
A man prepares to plug into a Tesla charging station in Fremont, California
A few hours earlier, he had announced on Twitter that the company's cosmic Roadster was en route to the asteroid belt, having overshot the trajectory for its planned Mars orbit. Then astronomers took a closer look at the data and concluded the car wouldn't make it that far. Not for the first time, SpaceX revised its projections.
Over the past five or so years, Mr Musk has outlined varying plans and deadlines for his ultimate goal of sending humans to colonise the Red Planet. Late last year, he said he expected SpaceX to send a cargo mission in 2022, to lay groundwork, followed by a manned mission in 2024. The practical difficulties and dangers of sending humans 140 million miles to Mars are huge. Nasa has been more circumspect, putting its estimate for a manned mission somewhere in the mid-2030s.
But the successes of SpaceX's more prosaic work - resupply missions to the space station, commercial satellite launches, Nasa and Air Force contracts - have propelled it to near the top of the list of the world's most valuable privately-held companies, with a $21.2bn valuation.
The company has pioneered new reusable rocket technology, wowing the world, as on Tuesday, with the sight of pencil-like rockets gracefully descending to land with pinpoint accuracy, on land and at sea. It has undercut Nasa and major established rivals such as Boeing to provide (relatively) cheap space flight.
The Falcon Heavy's 27 first stage rockets - essentially three Falcon 9s strapped together
And as SpaceX looks to the heavens, another of Mr Musk's companies is going underground. In October, the Boring Company won permission from the US government to dig a 10-mile test tunnel under Maryland.
Mr Musk hopes it will one day house the ""Hyperloop"", an electromagnetic bullet train he has boasted will carry passengers at up to 760mph (1223km/h). In July, he tweeted that he had won ""verbal government approval"" to build a Hyperloop between New York and DC that would reduce the journey time from three hours to 29 minutes. Officials said no such approval had been given.
The Hyperloop idea has its fair share of critics. Thom Neff, a civil engineer, put it succinctly when
, ""I would put what Mr Musk is saying today in the bullshit category."" A working Hyperloop is, without doubt, a long way off.
But to those who admire him, Mr Musk is a visionary, an irrepressible Howard Hughes-like figure revolutionising industry after industry. His two latest ventures, Neuralink and OpenAI, take him into the world of artificial intelligence.
His madcap ideas to save humanity from itself have even earned him the honour of a parody Twitter account, ""Bored Elon Musk"". On Tuesday, after one of Mr Musk's companies blasted a sports car into space and another reported record losses, his bored alter-ego put out a single tweet. ""Classic Tuesday,"" it said.

"Dizzee Rascsal: 'I should be headlining Glastonbury'
Dizzee Rascal says he deserves to be given top billing at the Glastonbury Festival.
""I've toured this festival for years, never disappointed,"" he told the BBC. ""You can always count on me.
""I'm basically at the stage where they need to make me headline this thing - because they ain't had no British rappers headline this festival.""
As if to prove his point, the star drew huge crowds to his set on The West Holts stage on Friday.
Running through hits including Fix U, Look Sharp, Bonkers and new single Space, he provided a raucous counterpart to Radiohead's more cerebral set on the Pyramid Stage.
Although Dizzee's appearance put him at the top of the bill on the festival's third-biggest stage, he asked why US rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West had been made main stage headliners ahead of their British counterparts.
""I've been on the main stage, but I need to headline the whole ting,"" he said.
""I've got 15 years of bangers. I'm confident I would tear it up.""

"100 Women: I want to break the stigma of painful sex
Callista is finally living pain free
One woman's story of a decade of wrongly diagnosed sexual pain has inspired a play - and with it, the hope that other women with sexual dysfunction can be helped.
It was on a cold winter's day just over a year ago that actress Emily Francis heard an item on the radio that moved her to tears.
""I felt desperately sad listening to Callista's story. This problem with her vagina had destroyed her life. She'd lost her relationship, become depressed... it felt tragic,"" she says.
Callista, a fashion stylist in San Francisco, had been speaking to BBC 100 Women about her long journey to finding a cure for unbearably painful sex.
When Callista first tried to use a tampon aged 12, she experienced a searing pain at the opening of her vagina. For years after that, even while she was sitting down or going about her day she would experience a burning sensation between her legs. When she touched her vagina, she says the pain was much more intense and it felt like she was being cut.
Emily wrote and stars in the play based on Callista
Callista finally worked up the courage to talk to a doctor about it when she was in her 20s. They did an examination and said she looked perfectly normal and that the pain must be psychological. So she went to see a counsellor, who told her the same thing.
As she got older, it became even harder to deal with.
""When I was in my mid-20s I met someone amazing and we fell in love and we got a place together by the beach,"" says Callista.
""We had sky lights in the kitchen, a piano and a big dining table where we hosted dinner parties... It was the life I always dreamed of. We talked about marriage... but there was always a 'but'.
'When we had sex it was excruciating. I either had to black out and leave my body, or get really drunk to endure it. When you're with someone who loves you very much, it's horrible. He couldn't accept it.""
Eventually Callista and her boyfriend broke up.
""It was the saddest thing ever. I was heartbroken.""
But the pain wasn't just affecting her relationship. It made her depressed, distracted her at work and damaged her relationship with her parents. Counsellors said the pain may have been linked to the fact that her parents were religious, so Callista started to blame them.
Eight years later and after seeing 20 different doctors, Callista finally found herself in front of a specialist who told her she had congenital neuroproliferative vestibulodynia. It meant she was born with 30 times the normal amount of nerve endings in the opening of her vagina - and she was able to have surgery to cure it.
Listening in London, Emily felt so frustrated by this aspect of the story that she got in touch with Callista.
The Internet Was Made for Adults is currently showing in London's Vault Theatre
""I felt so angry that she was told the problem was all in her head for so long,"" she says.
""Why was this girl's life allowed to be so marred by something so simple in an era of modern medicine?""
Over the next few months, Emily and Callista spent hours engrossed in cross-Atlantic conversations. Emily felt compelled to find out more about the condition.
She discovered that although Callista's specific condition is quite rare, vulvodynia is not uncommon. That refers to experiencing pain when the vagina is touched or pressure is applied to it, or constant spontaneous pain.
Research studies suggest as many as 16% of women in the US suffer from it at some point in their lives.
There are no official statistics on how many women in the UK are affected by it.
""The idea that lots of people are not able to experience sex without pain is horrible and everything we read pointed to the idea that the reason was partly because women don't know how to talk about it, or they accept it,"" says Emily.
""Even some women in our [play] production team accept it as 'normal'. It's accepted that 'the first time normally hurts.'""
Emily also wanted to tackle another aspect; why so many doctors said the pain was psychological. Emily spoke to some doctors she knew. One hadn't heard of vulvodynia and others had heard of it but weren't given much formal training on causes, diagnosis or treatment. That reflected what she'd heard in the BBC's investigation that revealed
""We felt like women and men deserve to have the ability to have a happy, pain free sex life. It's a fundamental part of what it is to be a human being,"" says Emily.
Callista has read the script of the play and is honoured to have inspired it. But what the play doesn't cover is what happened after Callista's surgery.
The procedure involved removing a layer of skin around the opening of her vagina and replacing it with her healthy cells from elsewhere and it took her months to heal.
When she was finally ready to have sex, Calista had a slight problem - she was single. She opted for a pragmatic approach.
""I just called up my very good friend and I was like, 'Come round and let's do it!'""
Callista was able to have pain free sex for the first time in her life.
Callista is enjoying her new-found energy and freedom
""I couldn't believe it. I was elated, I was ecstatic. I cried, it was so emotional and it was so beautiful.'
She went onto have a relationship with someone else (""it was fun, we were like teenagers having sex everywhere"") but eventually she realised the great sex masked other problems in the relationship. They have split up and now Callista says she is on a quest to find out what sex means for her.
""It's been transformative in every possible way. I am living pain free and I believe in myself again,"" she says.
Callista feels excited about the play in London and hopes it means no one else has to have the same struggle she did.
""What I want the most in the whole world, is for young women who are up against this to know that there is a language for their issue, it's not some mysterious, imagined thing. It's real,"" she says.
""I want every young girl and woman to know it's not her fault and that she isn't the only one.""

"Dali's moustache 'intact at 10 past 10', exhumation finds
Ms Martínez (right) says she was born in 1956 as a result of an affair between Dalí and her mother
Salvador Dalí's moustache is intact in the ""10 past 10"" position, the surrealist painter's foundation has said, a day after his body was exhumed.
""It was like a miracle,"" said Narcis Bardalet, who was in charge of embalming Dalí's body 28 years ago, adding that the hair was also intact.
The body was exhumed in the north-eastern Spanish city of Figueres to settle a paternity case.
A woman says her mother had an affair with the world-famous artist.
If María Pilar Abel Martínez is proved right, she could assume part of Dalí's estate, currently owned by the Spanish state.
Dalí's body was exhumed from a crypt in a museum dedicated to his life and work on Thursday evening.
""When I took off the silk handkerchief, I was very emotional,"" Mr Bardalet told RAC1 radio station on Friday morning.
""I was eager to see him and I was absolutely stunned. It was like a miracle... his moustache appeared at 10 past 10 exactly and his hair was intact,"" he added.
Lluís Peñuelas, the secretary of the Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation, said that it was ""a moving moment"".
Forensic experts leave the Teatre-Museu Dalí in Figueres following the exhumation
DNA samples have been taken from the artist's teeth, bones and nails in a four-hour operation, the officials say.
It may take weeks before the results of the tests are known.
The exhumation went ahead following a court order on behalf of Ms Martínez.
This was despite the objections of the local authorities and the Dalí Foundation, both of which said that not enough notice had been given.
Ms Martínez, a tarot card reader who was born in 1956, says her mother had an affair with Dalí in the year before her birth.
Her mother, Antonia, had worked for a family that spent time in Cadaqués, near the painter's home.
Ms Martínez's action is against the Spanish state, to which Dalí left his estate.
Will Gompertz explained how Dali's body would be removed
Ms Martínez says her mother and paternal grandmother both told her at an early age that Dalí was her real father.
But the claim has surprised many, including Ian Gibson, an Irish-born biographer of Dalí, who said that the notion of the artist having an affair that produced a child was ""absolutely impossible"".

"Reality Check: How much will Labour's NHS plans cost?
Labour has begun setting out its plan for the NHS in England if the party wins in June.
This includes a pay increase for staff, putting into law the mandatory minimum number of staff per patient and funding training for health professionals.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Labour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said the money for these pledges would be raised by increasing corporation tax.
How much will need to be raised has not yet been confirmed.
Corporation tax - the tax on companies' profits - has been cut from 28% in 2010 to 19%, and is due to come down to 17% by 2020.
to calculate that between 2016-17 and 2021-22, cuts to corporation tax would amount to £64bn less in the public purse.
We are talking about the NHS in England only since health is a devolved matter and the other nations' administrations generally set their own policies.
For example, although the recommendations of pay review bodies are UK-wide, nations get to choose whether to accept them.
It is unlikely that the precise figures behind Labour's policies will be available until the party's manifesto is published, next month.
Even then, we probably will not know exactly by how much pay will be increased and what level the minimum staffing will be set at, so it's difficult to say exactly how much this all going to cost.
However, we can estimate how much various elements of the pledge might cost.
Labour said it would increase pay to a ""sustainable level"" and lift the pay cap currently in force that means NHS staff pay has not increased by more than 1% a year for the past six years, although many staff also get incremental pay-rises to reflect progression within their roles.
We don't know exactly what a ""sustainable increase"" will be.
Mr Ashworth said the decision would be taken by an independent pay review body.
Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, has estimated that every 1% pay rise would cost £500m a year.
Labour's own estimates put it at £350m, but this excludes doctors.
When the government cut funding for health students by replacing grants with loans, it calculated this would save the Treasury £800m, so we can reasonably say reversing this cut would cost the same amount.
Labour also set out plans to introduce mandatory minimum staffing levels.
Sir Robert Francis' report into the failings at the Mid-Staffordshire Foundation Trust published in February 2013 found low levels of staffing were linked to poor care and recommended minimum safe staffing levels should be drawn up.
The Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs responsible for overseeing government expenditure, estimated last year that the NHS was short-staffed by about 50,000. Employing this number of extra people could cost about £2-3bn depending on how many of them were nurses, doctors or in other roles.
The NHS spends about £40bn a year on front-line staff.
Another 50,000 staff would be about a 6% increase to the total number of NHS staff caring for patients, amounting to an extra £2.4bn on the pay bill.
This is a very rough estimate.
Mr Ashworth also pointed out that hiring more staff and raising their pay would help reduce the NHS's dependency on agency workers who cost the health service more than salaried employees.
In 2015, agency nurses cost, on average, an estimated £39 per hour, compared with £27 per hour for NHS staff bank nurses.
However, this is not the only way Labour has promised to spend the extra money from raising corporation tax.
Since Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the party, in 2015, Labour has pledged to raise corporation tax to fund:

the scrapping of university tuition fees

"Oscars close awards season darkened by #MeToo cloud
Updated 1510 GMT (2310 HKT) February 26, 2018
Oscar-winning best pictures
The first Academy Awards were given out at a dinner on May 16, 1929. The best picture winner was 1927's ""Wings,"" a film about World War I pilots starring Clara Bow, right, Charles ""Buddy"" Rogers, left, Richard Arlen and Gary Cooper. Even today, the silent film's aerial sequences stand out as some of the most exciting ever filmed. Another film, ""Sunrise,"" was given an Oscar as most ""unique and artistic production,"" an honor that was eliminated the next year. The academy didn't begin using a calendar year for awards until movies made in 1934 (with ceremonies held in 1935). While the Academy awards the Oscars for work from the previous year, we are listing these with the years of the actual ceremony to avoid confusion.
Oscar-winning best pictures
'The Broadway Melody' (1930)
The musical ""The Broadway Melody"" was the first sound film to win best picture. The film stars Charles King, Anita Page and Bessie Love.

Oscar-winning best pictures
'It Happened One Night' (1935)
""It Happened One Night"" was one of the great underdog winners. Its studio, Columbia, wasn't considered one of the majors at the time, and neither Clark Gable nor Claudette Colbert, its stars, were excited about the project. But it became the first film to sweep the five major categories of picture, actor, actress, director and screenplay. To this day, only two other films -- ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) -- have pulled off the same trick.

Oscar-winning best pictures
'Gone With the Wind' (1940)
Still considered one of the great Hollywood epics, 1939's ""Gone With the Wind"" won 10 Oscars, including best picture and best actress for star Vivien Leigh, right. Though Clark Gable was nominated for best actor, he lost to Robert Donat (""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"") in one of the great Oscar upsets.

'The Best Years of Our Lives' (1947)

Unlike the 2006 remake with Sean Penn, this adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was a critical and box-office success. Star Broderick Crawford also won the best actor award for his role as Willie Stark, a cynical politician who rises to become governor. Any resemblance to Louisiana's Huey Long was mere coincidence.

Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's screenplay about an aging actress (Bette Davis, right) battling a scheming newcomer (Anne Baxter) remains one of the most quotable movies ever almost 65 years after its release. ""All About Eve"" held the record for a movie with the most Oscar nominations (14) until ""Titanic"" tied it in 1997. A young Marilyn Monroe, center, also attracted attention in an early role.

Producer-director Cecil B. DeMille had been making epics since the silents, but none had won best picture until ""The Greatest Show on Earth,"" a 1952 circus spectacular with Betty Hutton, pictured, and Charlton Heston.

Hollywood studios saw television as the enemy in the 1950s as Americans stayed home in droves to watch series such as ""I Love Lucy."" But live TV plays soon were providing material for movies, including 1955's best picture winner, ""Marty."" Ernest Borgnine won stardom and the best actor award as a lonely butcher in the Paddy Chayefsky drama.
Oscar-winning best pictures
'Around the World in 80 Days' (1957)
Responding to the competition from TV, the movies turned increasingly to epics in the 1950s such as producer Mike Todd's ""Around the World in 80 Days.""

Oscar-winning best pictures
'The Bridge on the River Kwai' (1958)

Julie Andrews' fans were upset when the original Broadway star of ""My Fair Lady"" wasn't chosen for the film of the Lerner-Loewe musical. Audrey Hepburn may not have been convincing as a guttersnipe in the opening scenes of George Cukor's best picture winner, but no one could deny she was ravishing in Cecil Beaton's costumes once Eliza Doolittle had been transformed into a swan.

Debra Winger, Shirley MacLaine and Jack Nicholson starred in James L. Brooks' adaptation of Larry McMurtry's novel about an up-and-down mother-daughter relationship.

""Platoon"" made headlines in 1986 for its blunt and unsparing look at the U.S. experience in Vietnam. It follows a small group of men, including leaders Willem Dafoe, pictured, and Tom Berenger, who play on the loyalties of raw recruit Charlie Sheen. The film made director and writer Oliver Stone, himself a Vietnam veteran, a household name. ""Platoon"" won four Oscars, including best picture and best director.
Oscar-winning best pictures
Director Bernardo Bertolucci's film about the life of Chinese emperor Puyi won nine Oscars -- quite an achievement, considering it was nominated for zero awards in the acting categories. Besides best picture, it also won best director, best adapted screenplay and best cinematography, among others.
Oscar-winning best pictures
Though ""Rain Man"" is ostensibly about the relationship between Dustin Hoffman's autistic Raymond Babbitt and his brother, Charlie (Tom Cruise), it's probably best remembered for Hoffman's performance as a savant who can do complicated calculations in his head, count cards in Las Vegas and never miss an episode of Judge Joseph Wapner's ""People's Court."" The film won four Oscars, including a best actor award for Hoffman and a best director trophy for Barry Levinson.
Oscar-winning best pictures
'Driving Miss Daisy' (1990)
Stage actress Jessica Tandy finally became a movie star at age 80 as an Atlanta Jewish matriarch who develops a close relationship with her driver, Hoke, played by Morgan Freeman, in Bruce Beresford's film of Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play. ""Driving Miss Daisy"" didn't compete for best picture against some of the year's most acclaimed movies -- ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape,"" ""Do the Right Thing"" and ""Drugstore Cowboy"" weren't nominated for the top award.
Oscar-winning best pictures
'Dances With Wolves' (1991)
In what was essentially a two-horse race, Kevin Costner's three-hour ""Dances With Wolves"" faced off against one of Martin Scorsese's best, ""Goodfellas."" ""Dances With Wolves,"" about a Civil War soldier who falls in with a Lakota tribe in the American West, was the decisive winner, earning best picture, best director for Costner and best adapted screenplay for Michael Blake, three of its seven Oscars. ""Goodfellas"" won just one: Joe Pesci's best supporting actor trophy.
Oscar-winning best pictures
'The Silence of the Lambs' (1992)
It's rare that a film released early in the year manages to even get nominated for best picture, not to mention winning the award, but ""Lambs"" -- based on the Thomas Harris novel about a serial killer helping an FBI agent to catch another killer -- took home best picture, best actor (Anthony Hopkins, who plays Hannibal Lecter), best actress (Jodie Foster), best director (Jonathan Demme) and best adapted screenplay. Hopkins' performance had relatively little screen time -- less than 20 minutes -- but was so commanding he can be credited for the continuing fascination with Lecter, who now headlines an NBC series.

""It's a hell of a thing, killing a man,"" says Clint Eastwood's gunfighter, William Munny, in ""Unforgiven"" -- and, indeed, the Western can be seen as one of Eastwood's many meditations on the impact of violence in society. The actor and director plays Munny, a retired outlaw who is drawn back into his old role to avenge himself on a brutal sheriff (Gene Hackman). ""Unforgiven"" was just the third Western to win best picture, after ""Cimarron"" (1931) and ""Dances With Wolves"" (1990).

By 1993, Steven Spielberg was already known as one of the great directors in Hollywood history, but an Oscar had eluded him. That changed with ""Schindler's List,"" a gripping story about a German industrialist who saved more than 1,000 Jews during the Holocaust. The film earned honors for picture, director, adapted screenplay and cinematography.

'The English Patient' (1997)
Some found it lyrical. Others, such as an episode of ""Seinfeld,"" mocked it as boring. Either way, ""The English Patient,"" with Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas, was a huge hit with audiences and critics -- and with the academy, which bestowed nine Oscars on the film about a burned British soldier and a loving nurse. Among the winners: director Anthony Minghella and supporting actress Juliette Binoche.

In the months leading up to its release, ""Titanic"" was rumored to be as big a disaster as the ship on which its story was based. But director James Cameron had the last laugh: When the final results were tallied, ""Titanic,"" with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, had become the biggest box-office hit of all time (since surpassed by another Cameron film, ""Avatar"") and winner of 11 Oscars in 1997 -- the most of any film since 1959's ""Ben-Hur."" Cameron took home a trophy for best director, too.

'Shakespeare in Love' (1999)
Was the film really that good or had Harvey Weinstein, its co-producer and head of studio Miramax, done an exceptionally good job at lobbying? Either way, there were gasps when best picture went to ""Shakespeare"" and not to favorite ""Saving Private Ryan."" Still, ""Shakespeare"" had plenty going for it, including an Oscar-winning best actress performance by Gwyneth Paltrow (here with Joseph Fiennes) and a clever script by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard. It won seven Oscars total.

""Birdman,"" starring Michael Keaton, also won three other Oscars: best director, best cinematography and best original screenplay. The film, about a onetime superhero actor making a comeback bid through a Broadway play, was filled with unusual touches: It was filmed as if all one shot, scored with a jazzy-drum soundtrack and shaded with magical realism.
Oscar-winning best pictures
""Spotlight"" -- a film about Boston Globe investigative reporters digging into a sex abuse scandal involving Catholic priests -- won best picture at the 88th annual Academy Awards.

""Moonlight,"" a coming-of-age drama about a gay black man in a rough Miami neighborhood, was named the winner for 2016 -- but only after ""La La Land"" was mistakenly announced first. ""Moonlight"" is based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's play ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue.""
The Oscars mark the official end of Hollywood's awards season, which, thanks to the Olympics, this year extends into early March. But as opposed to being the celebratory exclamation point on all that self-congratulation, the prevailing mood may be closer to relief.
A wide-open best-picture field has stoked excitement about the outcome of the 90th Academy Awards, providing a level of suspense that's often missing. A parade of award shows and critics honors dating back to December has only vaguely clarified the contours of that race, while anointing clear frontrunners in key acting categories.
Yet the awards also mark the close of an award season shrouded in the fallout from the
scandal, and accusations of sexual misconduct against a number of high-profile show-business and media figures. The related #TimesUp and #MeToo movements, in fact, have overshadowed some of the other controversies that have hovered over recent ceremonies, including #OscarsSoWhite, which compelled the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to implement changes in its composition.
That's not to say that representation as it pertains to people of color is no longer an issue, but a number of high-profile nominees this year -- and winners in 2017 -- have pointed to signs of progress. In addition, the explosive success of ""Black Panther"" will surely be noted at this year's Oscars, even if the film itself won't be eligible for consideration until 2019. (The film's star, Chadwick Boseman, joins the year's other breakthrough hero, ""Wonder Woman's"" Gal Gadot, among the presenters.)
, the academy was traditionally an honor club, one where people only really cared about who won. Today, the event has become ""a hot-button symbol"" of the industry's failings and excesses, putting the organization -- and thus the awards telecast -- in the uncomfortable and unfamiliar position of ""dealing with questions that their predecessors didn't have to grapple with.""
Politics has long been a regular feature of the Academy Awards, perhaps especially since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, when Michael Moore denounced President Bush during his acceptance speech for the documentary ""Bowling for Columbine.""
Further controversy will surely surround Hollywood's relationship with the Trump administration, even if the attention paid to sexual harassment has pushed that into the background at recent run-up award shows, at least compared to the volleys of criticism and satire directed at the incoming administration last year.
As usual, how much political dialogue finds its way into the ceremony will likely have a great deal to do with who wins. As usual, best documentary could be a category to watch in that regard, with the producer of the nominated ""Last Men in Aleppo,"" Syrian national Kareem Abeed, having been
to travel to the U.S. to attend the ceremony.
The Oscars also figure to have a significant international flavor, a sign of the globalization of the movie business. Guillermo del Toro, for example, is considered the favorite to win best director for
which would the fourth time that prize has gone to a filmmaker from Mexico in the last five years.
For an entertainment industry that wants to reach the world, a US president who proudly proclaims ""America First"" as his mantra is a potential source of friction. And if ""Awards First"" remains the academy's primary goal, based on recent history, there are likely to be plenty of unavoidable twists and subplots.
The Oscars will air March 4 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.

"'Dwarfism always seems to be the butt of jokes'
Mary Russell, a black woman with dwarfism, set off on a 21-day, 900-mile trip down the Ho Chi Minh trail with five other disabled people. She imagined it would be a unifying experience, but in fact she felt isolated among people she thought would be more like her.
""What made it for me was the beautiful scenic views,"" she says. ""How can you be miserable when you're looking at mountains?""
But in fact, for some of the time at least, Russell would feel more isolated and different than she had done before.
Russell is used to her difference. She grew up as one of nine children, but the only one with achondroplasia - a common cause of dwarfism - and her skin-colour could also cause issue in 1970s Yorkshire when ""awareness just wasn't there"".
For the journey through Vietnam, Russell, 48, travelled in a vehicle with Vicky Balch, who lost her leg in the Alton Towers rollercoaster accident and Steve Brown, a Paralympic wheelchair rugby player who's paralysed from the chest down.
Louise Halvey, who has progressive hearing loss, travelled on a motorbike alongside Charlie Lewis, who opted for a right leg amputation after a snowboard accident, and Andy Slade who lost an arm in an industrial accident.
But there was a new kind of difference here - Russell was the only one of the six to have always had a disability rather than having acquired it later in life.
""The group had all gone through something quite traumatic and I had to try to figure out where I fit in with that,"" she says.
The rest of the group were able to talk together about how they became disabled by accident or illness and how it made them feel but Mary felt left out because she had never had that experience.
""It was hard because they weren't born this way, they lived most of their life mingling with society, and at times I felt like I needed a limb missing so I could feel part of the group.""
The team travelled from the north to the south of the country and spent up to seven hours a day in the car, which she describes as ""really rough"".
As the others bonded over coming to terms with a new impairment, Russell became affected by what she acknowledges as her main disability - depression.
""My mood dipped almost immediately,"" she says.
The atmosphere in the car soured at times and arguments broke out. The group were often short on sleep and the travelling could be uncomfortable.
""I've struggled with depression, which nobody really understands because they automatically think it's the dwarfism that holds me back, but at times, mental health is my biggest challenge.""
Russell says she identified the slump in her mood early on in the journey when she ""felt like I was going out of control"".
She became fractious and tearful and with no one to confide in she told the whole group how she felt.
""I didn't want people to think this was how I usually am,"" she says. ""They said they were completely unaware I felt isolated but were grateful I had spoken and they became more inclusive.""
At home in London, Russell uses cycling as a ""remedy"" for her depression and when the group visited a village they spotted a boy with a bike. He was persuaded to lend it to her and she free-wheeled down the hill which gave her some relief.
Russell says the group provoked intrigue wherever they went, but she felt she received a ""double stare"".
""I stood out for sure,"" she says. ""I have the condition and I'm of colour.""
Mary's short stature often prompted laughter from Vietnamese locals which she found overwhelming at times.
""For some reason dwarfism as a disability always seems to be the butt of jokes and when they saw me they wanted to laugh, which is the battle we always have.
""They wouldn't touch me ... but people were fascinated by the others and wanted to touch their prosthetic legs.""
But there was an unexpected moment of joy one day which made Russell confront her own judgements.
""I met a guy, a dwarf, when we went shopping. He was stood outside his shop and at first I walked on by.
""For a moment I slipped into 'old Mary' where I wasn't comfortable with seeing someone like myself, but I made myself go back and say 'hello' to him.
""I immediately connected with him, we shook hands and hugged. It was the highlight of my trip.""
The group all completed the journey, weary but fulfilled. Russell remains close to Halvey and Slade who made her see her own prejudices.
""They helped me and gave me support,"" she says. ""They're both bikers so I didn't think I'd get on with them, but we hit it off and it made me realise you really can't judge anyone.""
Russell has taken part in reality TV before - in 2014 she appeared on the disability dating show, The Undateables.
The positive response she got from that boosted her confidence and she was signed to model agency, Models of Diversity, which has led to numerous photo-shoots and a fashion runway in Japan.
""From The Undateables onwards I started to find out things about myself - positive and negative,"" she says. ""Even if it upsets me I'm emptying out all the hurt and developing as a person.""
Though the Vietnam trip brought unwanted attention to her differences, Russell says it has made her accept herself in a new way.
""It made me realise that my limbs might be shorter, but they're functional and I can use them and should be grateful.
""I want to go to more places where there are less people like me. Everyone needs to see that this is what's in the world.""
Mary Russell's roadtrip story is told on Without Limits: Vietnam. The second episode will be broadcast Thursday 21 September at 20:00 on BBC One, and will be available to watch via BBC iPlayer for 30 days afterwards.

Former Denver radio DJ David Mueller was cross-examined on Wednesday
Taylor Swift's mother says her humiliated daughter told her a man had grabbed her inappropriately
The ex-radio disc jockey suing Taylor Swift vehemently denied under oath that he inappropriately touched the pop star, but acknowledged that a 2013 photo of them appears to show Swift trying to get away from him.
Under cross-examination on Wednesday as part of a federal civil trial, former KYGO radio host David Mueller testified that the photo of him and Swift from 2013 appeared ""weird"" and ""awkward.""
The civil trial centers on Swift's allegation that Mueller reached under her skirt and grabbed her behind during a meet-and-greet at Denver's Pepsi Center in June 2013. KYGO is a CNN affiliate.
Swift's team told KYGO about the incident, and Mueller, then 51, was fired two days later. In 2015 he sued Swift; her mother, Andrea Swift; and her radio promotions director Frank Bell, alleging that they pressured KYGO to terminate him and that he lost his job because of the false accusation.
Swift, who was 23 at the time, filed a countersuit in which she accused him of ""reaching under her dress and grabbing her bottom"" as they posed for the photo.
Mueller testified that his and Swift's hands and arms touched as they got into position for the photo. He said his hand was in a closed fist and touched what seemed to be her ribs, and he denied any groping or inappropriate contact on her rear end.
On cross-examination Wednesday Swift's attorney, Doug Baldridge, questioned the positioning of Mueller's hands at the photo-op.
""I know my palm was facing down. I do know that, sir,"" Mueller said.
Swift, one of the most powerful celebrities in the world, has been present in court in Denver along with her mother and Bell. They are expected to testify during the trial.
Andrea Swift was called to the stand on Wednesday afternoon as the case's second witness.
During her emotional testimony she gestured at Mueller and said, ""He sexually assaulted her. Right there, that guy.""
Swift's countersuit argues that the case will ""serve as an example to other women who may resist publicly reliving similar outrageous and humiliating acts.""
In this courtroom sketch, pop singer Taylor Swift, left, appears with her lawyer and mother in federal court in Denver on Tuesday.
A key piece of evidence in the case is the photo in question of Swift, Mueller and his then-girlfriend, Shannon Melcher, from the meet-and-greet.
The photo, leaked last year and shown in court, shows Mueller with his hand hidden from view below Swift's lower back. Swift's attorneys have pointed to that as evidence of the inappropriate touching, and noted that KYGO cited the photo as one reason for his termination.
However, Gabriel McFarland, Mueller's attorney, said the photo did not show any inappropriate under-skirt touching, as Swift has alleged.
""If you look at that photo, his hand is not underneath her skirt. It's not ruffled, rumpled, affected in any form or fashion,"" McFarland said.
Mueller testified that the groping accusation, which he maintains is false, cost him his future in radio.
""It cost me my career. It cost me my income. It's been hard on my family. It's been hard on my friends,"" Mueller said.
""I want to clear my name,"" he added.
Mueller's suit doesn't seek a specific monetary amount, but an expert retained by the ex-radio host determined that nearly $3 million was a fair compensation for damages.
However, Swift's attorney said in opening statements that Swift was ""absolutely certain"" that Mueller had grabbed her. Baldridge accused Mueller of filing the lawsuit for money and fame.
""He wants you to give him a payday,"" Baldridge told the jury of two men and six women. ""His motivation is money, calling attention to himself, and getting revenge on his boss.""
Baldridge also suggested that Mueller had rendered himself unemployable by publicizing the incident with Swift.
Mueller does not have a job in radio because he told 37 people about the accusations and because he hasn't applied for that many jobs, Baldridge said.
In his opening statement, Baldridge argued that Mueller had repeatedly changed his story about the photo-op and that he had destroyed evidence in the case.
In cross-examination Tuesday, Mueller said that he had recorded a conversation he had with his KYGO bosses discussing the alleged touching. However, Mueller admitted that several of his electronic devices broke and that unedited versions of those recordings had been lost.
In addition, Baldridge referenced Mueller's description of Swift in a court deposition as cold and standoffish. Hearing that, Swift sat up in court, looking disgusted. She then wrote on a yellow Post-It note and passed it to one of her attorneys sitting across the table.
Mueller testified that he drew that conclusion because Swift didn't welcome him into the photograph and paid more attention to his girlfriend at the time.
""She didn't acknowledge me when it was time to pose for the photograph,"" Mueller said.
Mother: Taylor said she was groped
Andrea Swift told the court that her daughter was visibly upset before the concert.
""Mom, a guy just grabbed my (rear end) in the meet and greet,"" Andrea Swift said her daughter told her. She described her daughter as humiliated.
During cross-examination the mother added that she couldn't believe Taylor thanked Mueller for being there.
""It made me, as a parent, question why I taught her to be so polite,"" she said. And Andrea Swift said she also now thinks they should have called police and reported the incident.
She said she wanted Mueller to get fired but didn't demand it of his employers.
Andrea Swift said her daughter now has smaller meet-and-greets with stricter security.

"Kim Dotcom demos micro-payment service to help stop piracy
Technology Reporter, BBC News
Kim Dotcom has launched a bitcoin-based micro-payments service to help people monetise their content
Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom has demonstrated a new micro-payments service that is designed to let people charge small amounts of money for any content they create.
Bitcache will let users make and receive Bitcoin payments.
to the US to stand trial for copyright infringement and fraud.
He said the platform will reduce online piracy by letting people pay for content from anywhere in the world.
The idea behind Bitcache is to turn any file uploaded to the platform into its own ""shop"".
Creators can upload any type of content to the service - such as a video, a song, images or computer code - and then choose how much money they want to charge.
That can be anything from $1 (Â£0.77) up. Bitcache will help to distribute the file across file storage websites, torrent sites and community file-sharing sites.
Even if the file is downloaded multiple times, it is encrypted and cannot be opened unless the user pays the required amount of money.
The service, which will eventually include a web browser extension and a mobile app, would also let media organisations, YouTube vloggers and bloggers to accept micro-payments from viewers.
So for example, when reading an online newspaper, watching videos on YouTube or reading a recipe, users could press a button on the page and pay a few cents for each piece of content they consume, using their Bitcache wallet.
Over $1m was raised on crowdfunding investment platform
in October 2016 to fund Bitcache, which is still under development.
went live on Tuesday, and 185,000 requests were received asking for access, but only 10,000 invitations were sent out.
The service is set to launch in mid-to-late 2018.
The Bitcache project has so far received a lot of support
We uploaded a word document file to test the demo out
Mr Dotcom, the founder of content-sharing website
, said his technology will enable copyright holders to gain more revenue by making their content accessible in many countries.
He thinks this would act as a deterrent to piracy for people who are willing to pay for content, but are currently unable to get it from firms such as Netflix or Apple.
Using bitcoin would let people make anonymous payments quickly, but the technology is not geared up to make millions of payments a minute.
Bitcache was built to let this many transactions be performed at speed.
""Content often becomes available in one place in the world, and when people are willing to pay, and they try to, they get the message that the content is not available in their country,"" Mr Dotcom told the BBC.
""I think the solution to the piracy problem is to offer content globally at the same time, at the same price.
""There will always be people who will pirate content - you can't stop that, but you can get to all the people who have the money to pay for content, but have no way to access it. That's about $10bn worth of revenue that is just being left on the side.""
Ernesto van der Sar, editor of piracy news website TorrentFreak, told the BBC:
""I think Bitcache could help independent artists to spread their work to a larger audience and get paid for it at the same time. The more exposure the better.
""That said, I don't think that most people who currently pirate content are suddenly going to pay. They will look for free alternatives instead. These are often readily available, especially for mainstream entertainment.""
Mr Dotcom has been fighting extradition to the US since 2012, when
and his assets were seized.
The US Department of Justice has said Mr Dotcom and his associates enabled copyright infringement by letting users store pirated files in free cloud lockers.
Users posted links to the pirated content for others to download for free, but Megaupload would not close down lockers containing infringing content.
Mr Dotcom has long argued that he did not aid piracy because
that enabled copyright holders to delete links to pirated files, and without the link, a user could not reach the file.
To prevent such a situation occurring with Bitcache, the technology lets copyright holders to take control over files made of their content.
Kim Dotcom's mansion was raided in January 2012 by New Zealand secret service and the FBI
""If someone pirates Game of Thrones and charges money for it, the content provider can find the link, report it to the system and then claim that content,"" said Dotcom.
""They can change the price point so the user will have to pay the real price, and no matter where the [file] is located online, the content provider will now receive all the payments.""
Of course, this will not work on pirated files that have been uploaded via torrents, but he believes it will give content providers back control over their content, if they partner with his platform.
""The next generation of smartphones will transfer files in seconds,"" said Mr Dotcom.
""If content holders want to have any chance to combat piracy in a world that makes it increasingly easy to pirate, the best way is to turn every file into a shop.
""This is truly new - something like this doesn't exist yet.""

"EU mobile roaming charges scrapped
A European Union (EU) law to abolish roaming charges for people using mobile phones abroad comes into force today.
The new rules mean that citizens travelling within the EU will be able to call, text and browse the internet on mobile devices at the same price they pay at home.
The European Commission said the end of roaming charges was one of the
But a UK consumer group warned phone users could face ""unexpected charges"".
Until now roaming, or connection, charges have been added to the cost of calls, texts and internet browsing when consumers from one EU country travelled to another and connected to a mobile network there.
In some cases, mobile users have faced bills of hundreds of pounds if, for example, they have downloaded a film.
In a statement the European Commission said: ""Each time a European citizen crossed an EU border, be it for holidays, work, studies or just for a day, they had to worry about using their mobile phones and a high phone bill from the roaming charges when they came home.""
It had been working hard over the last ten years to fix this ""market failure"", it said.
""Eliminating roaming charges is one of the greatest and most tangible successes of the EU,"" the Commission added.
The new legislation means travellers can use their regular data allowance anywhere in the EU.

In addition, different providers included different countries in their roaming territories, such as the Channel Islands and Switzerland.

Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent
Just a few years ago, European mobile phone users travelling across the EU could face a nasty bill when they got home.
Over the ten year period that the European Commission has been bearing down on roaming charges, that risk has receded, and from today customers can call, text or download data on the same basis as they do at home.
But the Roam like at Home legislation only applies to travellers - calling another EU country from home will still incur extra charges.
The mobile phone industry battled long and hard with Commission over the details of the plan to end roaming, warning it could mean higher prices at home.
The Commission saw it as a vital part of creating a digital single market - but also as one of the few examples of an EU policy which would resonate with the public.
It would be up to a future UK government to decide whether to have the EU price restrictions on roaming or not after the UK leaves the EU.
They are contained within a European regulation, not a directive, so they have not been incorporated into UK law.

"Truffle tree pension scam cost victims tens of thousands
The lure of truffles was at the heart of one pension scam
As many as 245 members of the public have lost an average of £55,000 each, after falling victim to a series of pension scams.
Among those who lost money was a couple from Hereford, who invested in a firm producing ""truffle trees"".
Four people who ran 11 dishonest schemes have been ordered to pay back £13.7m they took from their victims.
The High Court ruling followed an application from
It was the first time such an order has been obtained, following new powers given to TPR under the 2004 Pensions Act.
In 2013, the Herefordshire couple transferred more than £78,000 to a man called Alan Barratt, after he told them they could get a better return on their investment.
They were assured the funds would be invested in low-risk investments. However, they were then sent details of a firm producing so-called truffle trees in the West Country.
Typically such providers inoculate oak trees with truffle fungi, with the promise of producing truffles within seven years.
Some providers sell oak trees infused with truffle fungus
The victim, a man aged 46, told the court: ""As a result of my dealings with Alan Barratt, my final salary pension is in a scheme that I don't understand the status of, but which I have been told is a scam.
""As far as I know, the majority of my pension fund is invested in truffle trees, but I doubt whether that is legitimate. My partner appears to have lost her pension too.
""I deeply regret ever listening to Mr Barratt.""
The couple did receive a payment of £11,800 as a commission from Mr Barratt. However, as a result they were sent a tax bill of several thousand pounds from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
A man from South Wales who gave up work to become a carer for his partner lost nearly £50,000.
After being approached by text message, he was persuaded to invest in the construction of time-share apartments in St Lucia.
""The loss of my pension will have a massive impact on my life,"" he said in a witness statement.
""When my children finish school, I will be around retirement age. There will be no money to draw down when I turn 55 and no pension savings for later life.""
Another man - a council tenant from Hull - lost £17,000 after being cold-called by Susan Dalton.
He was promised a return of 5% a year, plus a 10% cash lump sum up front. But he never saw any return.
In his judgement, Judge Mark Pelling ordered David Austin and Alan Barratt to repay £7.7m. Mr Austin and Ms Dalton were jointly liable for an additional £5.9m, he said.
He said he was satisfied that Austin was the mastermind behind the scam, which also involved another man called Julian Hanson.
TPR will now decide whether there is sufficient evidence for a criminal prosecution.

"Tim Farron: I decided to quit before general election
Tim Farron describes his emotions after quitting
Outgoing Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has revealed he decided to quit several weeks before the general election but did not announce his decision publicly.
Mr Farron said he had put the decision ""to bed"" about two weeks into the campaign, and denied deceiving voters by continuing to fight the election.
""I absolutely threw everything at it,"" he said.
He announced his departure six days after polling day, saying he was ""torn"" between the leadership and his faith.
The Liberal Democrats increased their tally of seats from nine to 12 at last month's general election, but their vote share fell from 7.9% to 7.4%.
In an interview with BBC Radio 5 live's Emma Barnett, Mr Farron said that under his leadership, the party had ""left intensive care and is back relevant"".
""My job was to save the party,"" he said.
""The Liberal Democrats still exist and we're moving forward.""
Mr Farron faced repeated questions about his views on gay sex during the campaign, and when he announced his resignation, said he had found it impossible to be a committed Christian and lead a ""progressive liberal party"".
Asked about his decision to quit, he said he had not wanted to ""become the story"".
""I made the decision about two weeks into the election campaign,"" he said.
""I thought there isn't a way forward out of this without me either compromising or just causing damage to the party in the long run.""
Tim Farron: Living as a Christian and being a political leader 'has felt impossible'
He said he had told himself to ""put that into a drawer, don't talk to anybody else about it, get on and do as good a job as you can during the election"".
Mr Farron said this had ""not in the slightest"" deceived voters, adding that ""in every election there is a reasonable chance that leaders will step down"".
""I just thought 'I am here to do a job,'"" he said.
A leadership contest is under way to replace Mr Farron - and with a week to go before nominations close, just one candidate, former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable, has come forward.
Mr Farron - who criticised Theresa May's unopposed ""coronation"" as Tory leader - said Sir Vince had already been subject to ""plenty of scrutiny"".
""If there's only one candidate, then that's how it is,"" he added.

Jennifer Lawrence explains her ""rude"" comment to Bafta host Joanna Lumley
Social media went into meltdown on Sunday night when
made a joke onstage at the Baftas.
Host Joanna Lumley introduced her on stage as ""the hottest actress on the planet"" to which Lawrence replied ""that was a bit much"".
Viewers thought Lawrence was making a dig, but speaking at the premiere for Red Sparrow on Monday night, she explained that was not the case.
""It was an inside joke that fell flat"" she told the BBC.
""Joanna and I are fine. I love Joanna,"" explained Lawrence after her Bafta comments.

""It would have been like, 'so you agree? You think you're really pretty'.'""
Lawrence added she had emailed Lumley after the ceremony to apologise and received a response saying: ""I have no idea what you're talking about.""

"Sebastian Vettel on his past, present & future
Sebastian Vettel on his past, present & future
Sebastian Vettel: 'My desire and hunger to win again is greater than ever'
Updated 1112 GMT (1912 HKT) August 31, 2017
No matter how grueling or physically demanding Formula One is on its drivers, Sebastian Vettel is sure the toughest test only comes once they hang up their helmets.
Nico Rosberg shocked the world of F1 when he announced his retirement from the sport less than a week after claiming his maiden world championship title in 2016.
The German spent most his life working towards reaching the pinnacle of his profession, deciding to quit once he'd reached it to spend more time with his young family.
With the stress, strain and intense pressure that the F1 calendar entails, would Vettel be tempted to copy his compatriot's decision and walk away from the sport for good?
F1 fans give verdict on 2017 season ... so far
F1 fans give verdict on 2017 season ... so far
""I don't know,"" the 30-year-old German driver tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies in an exclusive interview. ""I don't know much about his decision at the end of the day. I don't know if it was spontaneous or if it was an intention.
""I guess it's a very difficult probably the most difficult decision you have to make in your racing career or life.""
Vettel has achieved everything possible in F1 -- setting new, historic benchmarks in the process -- but the German is also conscious that there are few pastimes more thrilling than elite motorsport.
""Whatever comes after, you need to be aware of the fact that the source of adrenaline of rush, excitement, the biggest income in that regard is gone,"" he says with trepidation.
""It will never come back. That will be difficult to make friends with. I'd assume it's been hard for all the drivers to call it a day.
""You want to make sure that you lined up your ducks for the afterlife. The biggest challenge one day will be to quit and find something else that gives you a different sort of pleasure.
""You can drive other cars, but they're not as satisfying as driving a Formula One car.""
Perhaps, however, Vettel is better prepared for life after racing than many of his contemporaries.
""Well, I'm happy with the small things in life,"" he says, a content smile creeping across his face.
Born in Heppenheim, a modest, slow-paced town of 25,000 residents in western Germany, the 30-year-old recalls a place where children can walk to school without parents, or play unsupervised in the Old Town square.
'One of the greatest drivers I've ever seen'
'One of the greatest drivers I've ever seen'
Situated among vineyards and rolling, forested hills about an hour's drive south of Frankfurt, you would be hard pressed to find a starker contrast to the life Vettel leads now.
He might have become accustomed to a life of private jets and five-star hotels, but Vettel admits the change in lifestyle was abrupt.
""I don't think I got any preparation for this,"" he laughs. ""But then again, I got a lot because in many ways you can argue that all this (Formula One) is not the real world.
""But I think I'm fortunate enough to look back and say I had a real and normal childhood just like any other child.
""Maybe people always have the expectation of what our lives should look like, just because we have the opportunity. But then it's my choice and you know I'm happy with a normal life, with normal things that give me satisfaction.""
Vettel openly admits that the superstar lifestyle that being a F1 driver affords him doesn't provide the same satisfaction as a quiet night in with friends and family.
""I'm really happy when I'm at home, when I don't have a huge perfect menu or buffet,"" he says. ""I have to do breakfast myself. In the end, you always want the things that you don't have.
""I'm traveling a lot, so of course I appreciate sleeping in my own bed.""
Whenever Vettel has driven an F1 car, history seems to have followed in his slipstream. In 2010, aged just 23, the German became the sport's youngest-ever world champion.
He would go on to win four successive world titles, making him the youngest double, triple and quadruple champion of all time.
His first crown came down to a four-way final race decider against Red Bull teammate Mark Webber, Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton.
Hungarian Grand Prix and Alonso: The Circuit
Hungarian Grand Prix and Alonso: The Circuit
The youngest of the quartet, Vettel showed maturity and an assuredness behind the wheel that belied his age and took the checkered flag ahead of Hamilton.
""It was very difficult in Abu Dhabi, when I won the first championship, to realize that I actually did it,"" Vettel recalls.
""Since then, you know, it's different because you don't put yourself under that much pressure anymore.
""Saying that though, it starts from zero the next year and obviously the challenge was there and we went for it again and again and again.
""And now, a couple of years on that I haven't won the championship, I think my desire and hunger for winning again is greater than ever.""
Despite his relentless success, Vettel often drew criticism for being too highly-strung and hot-headed.
He acknowledges that he is now more relaxed than in his early 20s, but believes more of an issue was made of his temperament than needed to be.
""I think it's normal that people try to make a massive story out of it,"" he says. ""I think it's normal that if you really care for what you do and love what you do, you become very passionate about it.
""And that means also that, you know, being human you react from time to time.
""Sometimes good, people like it. Sometimes bad, people don't like it. So, I've been on both sides but, as I said, I think it's also a reminder that I still care.""
'Best moment is still to come'
Vettel's 2015 switch from Red Bull to Ferrari saw him wear for the first time the famous red that his idol wore in the photos that adorned his childhood bedroom wall.
Vettel comes across as a pragmatist. Even as a child, he recalls, his thought was always focused on winning his next kart race -- rarely did he let images of himself standing atop the podium as F1 world champion cloud his mind.
But he readily admits emulating seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher -- five of them with Ferrari -- would top his long list of previous achievements.
Vettel leads the current drivers' championship by seven points heading into this weekend's Italian Grand Prix at Monza.
Vettel: It was a 'close to perfect night'
Vettel: It was a 'close to perfect night'
He remains optimistic that he can give the home fans -- ""tifosi"" -- something to cheer about, not only on Sunday, but at the end of the season too in a year that Ferrari celebrates its 70th anniversary.
""I always feel that the best moment is still to come,"" Vettel says. ""And at the moment the best moment that I can picture is winning in red.
""Winning with Ferrari -- because it's what we set out to do when I joined -- is what my hero has done for so many years. Everybody inside the team is dying to get back to the top.
""And yeah, that I would imagine would be a great, great moment and I want to witness it. I want to make it happen. It's great I had a huge inspiration in my childhood.""
Vettel, though, scoffs at the notion a driver can only truly be considered great if he reaps success with two different teams.
""Usually the people that came come out saying that are the ones that didn't do it,"" he says dismissively. ""But no, I'm not bothered.
""I think you have great drivers in Formula One and a lot of things need to go right for you, personally, to be able to be in a position to win.
""There are drivers that had the potential in the past and because of their decisions, the team's performances it didn't come together.
""I'm quite happy with what I got now -- but not satisfied yet because equally I want more.""

Actor Hugh Jackman has revealed he sang in front of movie executives during a read-through for the film The Greatest Showman soon after cancer surgery.
Jackman says he is ""not sorry"" for the performance, despite his surgeon's advice not to.

"Anne Boden, the steelworker's daughter who started her own bank
BBC Wales economics correspondent
Anne Boden started her career on the counters at Lloyds Bank
The daughter of a steelworker and a department store worker from Bonymaen in Swansea, Anne Boden had a fairly ordinary Welsh childhood.
Now she's part of a revolution in the financial world - and has set up her own online bank.
As a pupil at Cefn Hengoed Comprehensive, Anne was good at sciences and went on to study chemistry and computer sciences at the local university.
That interest in technology has been a key driver throughout her 35-year career, which started on the counters of Lloyds Bank in London in 1981.
A turning point was the 2008 banking crisis. She describes the period as ""really horrible,"" one she remembers when people would literally leave their desks in tears.
Anne became chief operating officer for Allied Irish Banks - one of Ireland's big four - in 2012, when she had to pick up the pieces.
""I think for many, many years, we'd become invincible,"" she said of the industry. ""We started believing our own hype.
""After the financial crisis, I spent time out of the big banks, going around the world, figuring out what had happened and what we could do to fix it.
""When the call came to go into Allied Irish Banks,
and bring it back into profitability, we were having to reduce costs and deal with tens of thousands of Irish citizens who had really suffered from the financial crisis.
""It was a huge learning experience. And that's what really drove me to think we should do something different.""
The germ of an idea and a ""big dream"" eventually resulted in 2014 in the launch of Starling - using technology to develop a new-style bank.
Starling is digital-only, with customers using the app, with data and analytics to help them keep across transactions and manage different areas of their personal finances.
There are no branches and no-one sells financial products.
""Every other industry had changed: Amazon had changed shopping, iTunes had changed music. Nobody had actually fundamentally changed banking,"" she said.
""I was really worried people were putting banks back the way they were, pretending that the banking crisis hadn't happened. I knew I had to take the opportunity to do something different, and take a risk.""
It included selling a house in Swansea, where she spent weekends, so she could hire more people.
These are still early days for the bank
It is still early days. There are just over 100 staff at Starling and it has more of a feel of a technology company than a traditional finance institution.
Walking through its London office, there is an informality right down to the chill-out area with table tennis and table football.
People with different skills are mixed together - engineers sit alongside bankers and marketing experts.
What's amusing is that the office space used to belong to UBS, the giant bank Anne used to work for. But Starling is very different and is constantly changing and developing what it offers customers.
The bank has a feel of a technology company- including chill-out area
The whole organisation comes together at 4pm on Friday for ""demo time"" where the engineers and designers show what they've built - and then it is shown to customers the following week.
""We all work together, we only get something really innovative and creative if we get artists, engineers and finance people working together,"" she said.
""We have no departments here, we have people working together to make things happen.""
When do you relax and how?
I don't really relax but when I am not working I enjoy writing.
Where is your favourite spot in Wales - and why?
Must be Gower. When I was a child we would spend weekends in the summer at Port Eynon but now it must be Rhossili.
What would you say to a 16-year-old girl growing up in Wales now?
I had my inspiration from the television where I saw the odd career woman. Today anything is possible - the internet gives us a window on the wider world and that woman changing the world for the better could be you.
It's International Women's Day - what inspirational woman would you put on a bank note?
Madeleine Albright [US Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton] who said there was a special place in hell for woman who didn't help other women.
What's the next sector that needs a technological/disruptive shake-up?
The medical and health sector.
Being a woman in a male-dominated banking culture was an advantage, Anne believes in that it ""really helps you say what you really think, because you're not fitting in"".
""There aren't many women in finance and there aren't many women in tech,"" she said.
""I haven't seen many women throughout my career. I don't think I mentioned to anyone that it was strange being the only one or one of two women with a group of guys until four or five years ago. You didn't talk about that type of thing, you pretended it didn't happen.
Her involvement in computers so early on must have helped.
""I was very fortunate that I had a technology background and was working in the interesting bits of finance - I've been in the right places at the right times,"" she said.
""Women have to have a core skill - something that which differentiates them, to rise throughout organisations.
She believes that in male-dominated industries, men have to deal with much more peer pressure than women do. ""You know very well you never achieve fitting in - so be very good at standing out,"" she said.
""I've always been different. I've always had a Welsh accent, been slightly different to everyone else, I don't mind being different, the only woman in the room, the one who expressed a different opinion. You get used to having the confidence to change things, to innovate.""
Anne Boden explains how Starling is using data and analytics to build online banking for customers
Anne Boden does not have any children but does not think her career would have been any different if she had done.
She believes that once you get to a certain level of earning, having children is not a career problem but it is for those lower paid women who see all their caring responsibilities - for children, older people and partners - affecting their career.
Starling also includes men working part-time because of caring responsibilities.
""If women were earning more, if the percentage of women in certain professions were higher, women could overcome the fact that they are carers,"" she said.
""I know of women with big jobs who face the same challenges as me [without children].
"" I don't think as a women to be successful you have to be single minded and have no personal life ""
Anne believes everyone in Starling is quite opinionated and enjoys ""saying what we believe"".
""That sort of intensity of debate means people are doing the right thing,"" she added.
""We have a long way to go, we are still a very small organisation with very big aspirations. For me every single hour you spend in work should be something that does something useful. Work is a big part of most people's lives; we spend a lot of time here, you might as well enjoy it, you might as well do something to make the world a little better.""
Her own career path into banking was not planned.
""My expectation was to do something in science - in a rural town somewhere. I didn't think of myself as a big city person. My mother told me to apply for one job in a bank and in 1981 I arrived in London to work for Lloyds Bank.""
It took her to UBS in Switzerland before a senior global role at RBS and Dutch bank ABN AMRO.
But she believes the internet's power is in giving everyone an opportunity to learn more, compared to when she grew up in the 1960s and 1970s. And she has been impressed with some of the technology companies she has come across back in Wales.
""People growing up in this new world, being in one part of the UK shouldn't hold you back,"" she said.
""I'm proud of being Welsh, I believe in speaking out - the majority of people in Wales have access to facilities which allows them to do great things but we don't see many role models, there are very few out there speaking up for Wales.
""But we can support each other.""

"Lorde isn't here for unsolicited acne advice
Lorde has told fans who suffer from acne: ""I feel your pain"".
The singer posted an Instagram story about the unhelpful things people say to people who, like her, have the skin condition.
""Acne sucks. You know what also sucks?"" she asked in the video, before mocking the advice she's been given over the years.
The 21-year-old said she wants people to stop suggesting that moisturising will get rid of the problem.
Feb 16, 2018 at 9:19pm PST

""When you've had acne for years and years and years, done all the drugs, tried all the things, and people are still like, 'You know what worked for me, is... moisturising!',"" said the Green Light singer.
""'Make a mask out of honey, Greek yogurt and avocado. All you need to do is buy an apricot scrub! Coconut oil - the secret is coconut oil!""'
Katie Snooks posted videos online of her skin's transformation with a new treatment
Lorde said some people simply assume her skin is unclean.
""'Do you wash your face?' It's like, yes, I wash my face, I'm just genetically cursed,"" she said.
Lorde's second album Melodrama was nominated for a Grammy Award
The singer added that she believes it can get better.
""For anyone out there who has got bad skin - and actual bad skin, not the kind of bad skin you can just use a fancy cream for, for a few days, and it will get better.

"London paramedic has liquid thrown in face by masked men
A Met Police spokesman said the substance was non-corrosive but it is investigating
A lone paramedic had a substance thrown on to her face, neck and chest while answering a 999 call.
She was on her way to a patient when she was flagged down by three men who appeared to be in distress in Tottenham Hale, north London.
The 32-year-old stopped to help but they pulled bandanas over their faces before one threw liquid through her window.
She was taken to hospital after the attack on 16 July but later discharged.
A Met Police spokesman said the substance was non-corrosive but it is investigating the incident.
. Last year, it was used in 458 crimes, compared to 261 in 2015, according to Met Police figures.
The paramedic, who did not want to be named, was on her way to help a man suffering from chest pains when she was targeted in the early hours.
""It was terrifying. This was so cowardly,"" she said.
""It is my job to help people. I was on my way to help a patient and I stopped because I am caring and I thought they needed my help.
""They have taken away my trust.
""What they've done is horrific in so many ways. It was premeditated and it delayed a patient getting treatment.""
She said the attack took a paramedic off the road that night.
""And yet if one my attackers were hurt, I would still treat them because that is the job,"" she added.
The substance caused irritation to her face, neck and chest. The man who threw it was wearing latex gloves.
London Ambulance Service is reminding its staff of the need to be cautious when flagged down by anyone requesting help or assistance.

"General election 2017: What will happen to proposed laws?
The sun could set on a number of government bills
One of the knock-on effects of the snap election on 8 June is that the current session of Parliament is coming to an abrupt end.
The formal business will stop on Thursday, when the current Parliament is - to use its terminology - prorogued.
It will then be officially dissolved by the Queen on 3 May.
But before that happens, there will be a flurry of action as the fate of outstanding legislation is decided.
In what is known as the wash-up period, the Commons and Lords will decide what bills they want to let through and which they will effectively put out to grass.
Speaking on Monday, Commons Leader David Lidington said he hoped there would be a ""swift and orderly conclusion"" of parliamentary business.
One bill guaranteed to pass is the Northern Ireland Bill.
This is emergency legislation drafted to enable domestic rate bills to be calculated in Northern Ireland in the absence of a sitting assembly.
The bill, which will extend the period by which a functioning executive can be formed, in an attempt to resolve the current political deadlock, will be fast-tracked through Parliament on Monday.
Other bills that do not make the cut this time could be revived after the election should the Conservatives be re-elected.
But with Brexit looming large on the horizon, the scope for other legislation in the next few years is expected to be substantially reduced.
Some of the bills may never see the light of day again.
Just as intriguing are the changes that MPs and peers may demand from the government's business managers in return for approving legislation.
In past years, these have often been quite substantial, with whole sections of bills removed or, in some cases, clauses added to salvage them as they ""ping-pong"" between the two Houses.
So which bills are still in the mix and what is likely to happen to them?
Finance (No.2) Bill (will pass)
The bill, which enacts measures included in Philip Hammond's Budget last month, will be given priority and is expected to be rushed through its remaining stages in the Commons on Tuesday.
As well as enacting changes to duties, the legislation - whose approval by the Lords is a formality - includes provisions on tax avoidance and tackling childhood obesity.
Higher Education and Research Bill (likely to pass)
This bill, which is designed to increase competition and choice in higher education and raise standards in research and innovation, has been agreed in principle by both the Commons and Lords.
But amendments have yet to be hammered out as part of the process of ""ping pong"".
Given ministers have been defeated in the Lords on issues such as the scope of degree-granting powers, it might require compromises to get on the statute book.
No date has so far been set for final consideration.
Health Service Medical Supplies (Costs) Bill (set to pass)
This bill is on its final lap, with MPs due to consider a single Lords amendment relating to the life sciences sectors on Tuesday.
The legislation is designed to bear down on the spiralling cost of NHS medicines and other medical supplies and secure ""best value"" for the health service and taxpayers.
Digital Economy Bill (likely to pass)
This wide-ranging legislation will entitle consumers to minimum broadband speeds, increase protection for intellectual property online, restrict access to online pornography, provide more scope for data-sharing within the public sector and increase the powers of Ofcom with regard to BBC regulation.
It has commanded cross-party support throughout and is likely to become law, pending MPs' consideration of Lords amendments on Wednesday.
The Criminal Finance Bill (uncertain)
There is not much time for this big bill, which begins report stage in the Lords on Tuesday, to become law.
Peers have tabled 50 amendments, which could slow things down, but if the government and opposition can agree, possibly by setting aside the most controversial aspects, it still has a chance of making it through.
It includes new powers to oblige suspects to explain the origin of their assets and for the authorities to seize the proceeds of crime stored in bank accounts or used to purchase property or jewels.
It would also create a new offence enabling companies facilitating tax evasion to be prosecuted as well as measures on combating terrorist finance.
Technical and Further Education Bill (likely to pass)
Peers are due to consider Commons amendments to this bill - which is designed to improve the quality of technical education and apprenticeships while addressing skill shortages - on Tuesday. If there is enough time, the bill is likely to pass.
Neighbourhood Planning Bill (likely to pass)
Peers are due to consider Commons amendments to this bill - which aims to identify and free up more land for homebuilding and speed up the delivery of new homes - on Tuesday. If there is enough time, the bill is likely to pass.
Bus Services Bill (likely to pass)
Peers are due to consider Commons amendments to this bill - which will give new powers to English local transport authorities to introduce franchising and new partnership arrangements and to offer multi-operator ticketing services - on Tuesday.
Prisons and Courts Bill (shelved)
The government has already admitted this bill, put forward by the former Justice Secretary Michael Gove before the EU referendum, will be shelved, at least temporarily.
This is after MPs and peers stated there was not enough time to scrutinise its contents - which included changes to prison inspections and the use of mobile phones by prisoners, a new online dispute resolution system for civil cases as well as changes to judicial appointments and compensation for whiplash injuries.
The Vehicle Technology and Aviation Bill (carried over)
This bill, which would, among other things, change the motor insurance system to prepare for the arrival of driverless cars and incentivise the take-up of electric vehicles, has also come to a halt for now.
It hadn't progressed far enough in the Commons and has yet to be even considered by the Lords.
A motion has been passed carrying it over to the next Parliament.
The Local Government Finance Bill has also been parked for another day.
A host of bills tabled by backbenchers are currently working their way through the legislative system. Most are likely to run out of time, but a handful that have the support of the government could possibly become law if the Lords gets around to approving them.
Guardianship (Missing Persons) Bill:
Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake's bill would give the families of missing people greater control over their affairs. Dubbed Claudia's law, in memory of the chef Claudia Lawrence, who disappeared in 2009, it would establish a new legal mechanism to deal with the property and financial affairs of a missing person. Set to be debated in the House of Lords on Wednesday.
Merchant Shipping (Homosexual Conduct) Bill:
Tory MP John Glen's bill would repeal aspects of the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act that suggest it would be lawful to dismiss a seafarer for a homosexual act. Set to be debated in the Lords on Wednesday.
Farriers (Registration) Bill:
Proposed by Conservative Byron Davies but prepared by the Department for the Environment, this bill would alter the governance and membership of the Farriers Registration Council, which was set up in 1975. Set to be debated in Lords on Wednesday.
This would allow journalists to examine the accounting records of local authorities and other public offices, including parish councils, police and crime commissioners, fire authorities and NHS clinical commissioning groups. Set to be debated in Lords on Wednesday.
The early election could also mean delays to changes in the following areas.
Air pollution plan (publication delayed until September)
Boundary review of UK constituencies (put back until 2022 election)
The national funding formula for schools in England (consultation closed in March)
White Paper on grammar schools (due in June but could be delayed)

"Bond producers to make Blake Lively thriller
Blake Lively has two daughters with husband Ryan Reynolds
The producers of the James Bond films are to make a ""female-driven"" thriller starring The Shallows' Blake Lively.
Based on the novel by Britain's Mark Burnell, The Rhythm Section will see her as a woman who becomes an assassin to avenge the deaths of her family.
Reed Morano, who directed the first three episodes of hit TV series The Handmaid's Tale, will direct the film.
Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson said it was ""exciting"" to work with such a ""talented"" team.
Morano and Lively, they added, ""have a strong vision for this very compelling story driven by a female protagonist"".
The Rhythm Section is the first of four novels to feature Burnell's Stephanie Patrick heroine, inviting the prospect of a Bond-style film series.
Broccoli and Wilson have co-produced the last eight Bond films
Its announcement comes during a hiatus in production on the James Bond films, which Broccoli and Wilson have co-produced since 1995.
Production on the film will begin later this year, with financing from international production company IM Global.
Its head Stuart Ford said the film would be ""fresh, realistic and bold"", with ""a unique female heroine who turns so many of the current cinematic cliches surrounding so-called 'kick-ass' female leads on their head"".
Lively, who is married to Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds, is best-known for her work in TV series Gossip Girl and for playing the ageless heroine of The Age of Adeline.
Last year saw her battle a shark in The Shallows, appear in Woody Allen's Cafe Society and give birth to her second child.

"Jury selected in Taylor Swift groping trial
Updated 1604 GMT (0004 HKT) August 8, 2017
Taylor Swift alleges DJ groped her
Taylor Swift alleges DJ groped her
Taylor Swift alleges a Denver radio host inappropriately touched her during a photo op
Opening statements in their civil trial were expected to begin Tuesday
An eight-person jury was seated Tuesday in Taylor Swift's civil trial over a backstage interaction between the pop star and a Denver radio host.
The civil lawsuit centers on
that former KYGO morning show host David Mueller, known professionally as ""Jackson,"" inappropriately touched her during a June 2013 meet-and-greet at Denver's Pepsi Center arena. KYGO is a CNN affiliate.
In 2015 Mueller sued Swift, her mother Andrea Swift and her radio promotions director Frank Bell, claiming that the touching allegations are false. His suit argues that they pressured KYGO to fire him and that he lost his job because of the false accusations. Mueller is seeking $3 million in damages.
Swift, who was 23 at the time of the incident, countersued Mueller, accusing him of ""reaching under her dress and grabbing her bottom"" as they posed for a photo. Her suit argues that KYGO terminated Mueller after its own independent investigation.
Opening statements were expected to begin Tuesday morning local time.
The photo of that meet-and-greet will be a central piece of evidence in the trial. Judge William Martinez granted Swift's request to seal the photo until the trial on the grounds that it could prejudice jurors, but it was leaked in 2016.
Swift, her mother and Bell are expected to testify. In addition, Lorrane Bayard de Volo, an associate professor from the University of Colorado Boulder's Department of Women and Gender Studies, is expected to offer expert testimony on the ramifications of sexual assault and harassment.
Taylor Swift's counter-lawsuit argues that the case will ""serve as an example to other women who may resist publicly reliving similar outrageous and humiliating acts."" Her suit also claims that any money recovered from the case will be donated to charitable organizations dedicated to protecting women from acts of sexual assault.
Court braces for Swift fans
Jury selection began on Monday and continued into Tuesday. The jury questionnaire asked potential jurors several questions about their personal opinions on Swift.
""Do you have any opinion of singer Taylor Swift?"" jurors were asked. ""Have you ever considered yourself a fan of Taylor Swift?""
""Is anyone in your immediate family a fan of Taylor Swift?"" another jury question asked.
Jurors were also asked about their experiences with inappropriate touching. One juror said he had friends who claimed to have experiences of being inappropriately touched, and another said his wife runs ""women's empowerment workshops.""
Mueller's attorney argued that Swift had made the case into ""a crusade for women's issues,"" stretching it beyond the incident in question.
To accommodate Swift's fans and other onlookers, the court designated 32 seats in the courtroom for the public. Outside the courthouse, a modest number of Swift fans lined up Tuesday for a seat in the courtroom and a glimpse at the star.
fans in line to get into the courtroom today. I counted 22 people a half hour ago. 32 public seats available
— Scott McLean (@scottmclean)
Ed Le, 50, and Vega Zaringlee, 10, were visiting from Seattle. Le said it was an ""awesome coincidence"" their family trip was at the same time as Swift's trial.
""It's been an awesome civics lesson for her and also supporting her fandom of Taylor,"" Le said.
Zaringlee agreed, saying she loved that Swift was trying to make a point with her countersuit. ""She just wants it to be a point that women need to stand up for themselves,"" Zaringlee said.
Jacquelyn Evans, a 32-year-old from Denver, said she was a huge Taylor Swift fan and admired the star for showing up at the trial.
""I think it's pretty cool that she's here to defend herself in person and not just kind of passing it off,"" she said. ""It shows that it's a serious issue to her and it's a really great experience for girls to see her come out and do that.""

"Election blind dates: Peter Stringfellow and Mary Beard
By Emma Ailes and John Harrison
BBC Victoria Derbyshire programme
What happens when two strong-minded individuals from opposite sides of the political debate sit down for dinner?
To find out, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has organised a series of election blind dates for the general election campaign.
Businessman Peter Stringfellow, who runs a gentleman's club in London, is a Conservative Party supporter, while historian, feminist and TV presenter Mary Beard says she is left-wing and proud.
They went into the meal without knowing who they would be meeting.
I'm Mary Beard and I am a professor of classics at the University of Cambridge. My day-job is working on Roman history and ancient Roman history. A few years ago now, I started doing Roman documentaries on both BBC Two and BBC One. It's got my face out there - for better or worse.
I would summarise my politics very simply as the maverick left and proud.
I had a good time. He's an engaging old rogue. He listens. I wish I'd landed a few more killer blows against some of the things on which we disagreed. And I do suspect that some of my friends will think that I didn't give him a hard enough time on the feminism.
I was so expecting it to be [businessman] James Dyson for some reason. I had to do a triple take and I thought ""Oh, it's Peter Stringfellow, isn't it?""
We talked about Tories, Jeremy Corbyn, aspiration and taxes.
Peter Stringfellow and Mary Beard talk feminism
We were both very strong Remainers and think that the EU referendum result is seriously worrying. Both of us want to live in a global world.
Peter thinks that high taxation somehow stamps on aspiration. He does seem to be quite committed to the idea that there is a financial incentive to what a lot of people do. The current social exclusion in this country is so unfair that if higher taxation could solve that, surely that's a good thing?
Did you convince him on anything?:
I thought the place I made the best hit actually was on taxation because I didn't think that Peter had a very good answer to the absolute blatant unfairness of social division. I think I did rather better on taxation than I did on the feminist issues. I think he's rather more practised at dealing with that actually.
We had a long head-to-head without much engagement about feminism, about what women want to do, and how that fits with having them take their clothes off. I think when I meet those arguments I tend to become a bit donnish, perhaps slightly finger-wagging.
Stringfellow invites Mary Beard to his club
I haven't ever been to a club where women take their clothes off. I've quite strong views about that but I've never seen it. If Peter follows up the invitation I shall go. I shall attend with some trepidation but I owe it to him to go and see what I criticised.
The best thing is that he was prepared to listen and engage and take the argument seriously.
I don't think his justification about women's aspirations and [his club] Stringfellows adds up for me.
Describe him in three words:
Elegant, intelligent rogue.
Oh, I can't answer that in a simple number because it depends on the criteria, right?
on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 BST on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.
Friday's election blind date will be Conservative John Whittingdale and Labour's Jess Phillips.
My name's Peter Stringfellow. Actually I'm Peter James Stringfellow. Peter J Stringfellow is how I sign my name. Not Pete. Never Pete. I suppose I'm best known as probably the night club guy. ""Hey aren't you in night clubs or something?"" Yeah, that's me.
I'm now a Conservative, providing the Conservatives are good for Great Britain and continue to be aspirational.
She was very pleasant, very sweet and very warm, and right from the off I knew we were all right. I enjoyed her company.
The minute I saw Mary, I was very pleased, because I'm a bit of history buff myself. The first thing I wanted to ask her about was the books on Rome.
What did you disagree on?:
Mary got a bit hung up about exploitation [of women]. She didn't use that word, but that's basically what she was trying to say. It's an old-fashioned attitude, we all exploit each other. Not in a nasty way. We all rely on each other to make our world spin around. Footballers earn Â£250,000-a-week. Are they being exploited, because some owners are making billions out of the actual football? No, not really. Everyone's happy, everybody's working and that's the same as my world.
Peter Stringfellow to Mary Beard: You're a pretty lady
Did she convince you on anything?:
Mary convinced me of nothing - except I like her, but I knew I would like her the minute I walked in the cafe and saw her. Did she change my views? Give her a break, we were only there for 40 minutes or something. But that's OK, I still liked her for herself.
Did anything surprise you?:
Close-up she's a very attractive woman. I would say, she doesn't really care that much about her cosmetic appearance. Of course, she cares, but not cosmetically. And I think she carries that as a banner. Look at my eyes, I don't care about the way I look. Having said all that, she can't help it. She's a very nice, soft, warm, [woman] and I find it attractive.
Three words to describe her:
Nine out of 10. I thought it was great. She was lovely.

"Brexit: SNP calls on Labour to keep UK in single market
The Scottish National Party is calling on Labour to work with other opposition parties to keep Britain in the single market and customs union after Brexit.
Its Commons leader Ian Blackford asked for help to stop the ""catastrophic damage"" of ""extreme"" Brexit.
""It is time for MPs of all parties to put politics aside,"" he said.
and could pay to access the single market like Norway.
Mr Blackford said he would invite other opposition leaders to a summit on 8 January when MPs return from the Christmas recess.
He said: ""As we saw with the successful amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill, when opposition parties work together effectively it is possible to secure a parliamentary majority and deliver change in the national interest.""
The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Greens have all said they want the UK to stay in the single market and customs union after Brexit - something Prime Minister Theresa May has already ruled out.
Labour's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has also faced criticism over his refusal to support a second referendum on the final terms of the UK's exit from the EU.
He told the i newspaper: ""We have had a referendum which came to a decision. The negotiations are still ongoing, albeit well behind schedule, and we've set out the kind of relationship we want to have with Europe in the future.""
Tom Brake, Brexit spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said the Labour leadership had ""shirked their responsibility"" to provide effective opposition to the government.
""The Labour leadership has constantly played a game of smoke and mirrors over their Brexit position.
""But here they are nailing their colours to the mast in support of hard Brexit,"" he added.

"Long seen as a rising star in the Conservative Party, Priti Patel has now resigned from the cabinet minister after it emerged she had held undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials while on holiday.
Elected as an MP in 2010 the prominent Brexiteer, 45, became a Treasury minister in 2014, before becoming Employment Minister after the 2015 general election.
And shortly after Theresa May became Prime Minister - following the June 2016 EU referendum - Ms Patel was promoted to Secretary of State for International Development.
Born in London to Gujarati parents who fled Uganda in the 1960s, she was educated at Watford Grammar School for Girls.
She went on to study at Keele and Essex universities before getting a job at Conservative Central Office, which she left to head up the press office for the Referendum Party, under Sir James Goldsmith, from 1995 to 1997.
After William Hague became Conservative leader, she returned to the party to be his deputy press secretary, from 1997 to 2000.
She went on to spend a number of years working with the Weber Shandwick public affairs consultancy - advising Ikea and the Meat & Livestock Commission among others - and had a spell as international public policy adviser for drinks giant Diageo.
Ms Patel sought to get elected to Parliament in 2005 but lost out in Nottingham North. A year later, she was one of those selected for new leader David Cameron's A-list of candidates and went on to become MP for Witham, Essex, in 2010.
Watford Grammar School; economics degree from Keele University, MSc in British government and politics from University of Essex
Born to Gujarati parents who fled Uganda in the 1960s. Married with a seven-year-old son
Elected Witham MP in 2010. Became Treasury minister in 2014 and Minister for Employment in 2015. Appointed Secretary of State for International Development in July 2016
She is positioned on the right of the party, voted against gay marriage, campaigned against the smoking ban, and previously advocated bringing back the death penalty, before later saying she did not support it.
Ms Patel, whose father stood as a UKIP councillor in 2013, cites Margaret Thatcher as her political hero.
A longstanding Eurosceptic, dating back to at least her Referendum Party days, Ms Patel was a leading figure in the successful Vote Leave campaign.
There was also controversy when it emerged she once called for the foreign aid department to be scrapped in its current form.
in 2013: ""A long-term strategic assessment is required, including the consideration to replace DfID [the Department for International Development] with a Department for International Trade and Development in order to enable the UK to focus on enhancing trade with the developing world and seek out new investment opportunities in the global race.""
She later said she did want DfID to continue in its current form and backed Britain's legal commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid, although she insisted that it should provide better value for money.

"'Sexist' Next Gen Finals draw ceremony takes tennis 'back to zero'
Updated 1155 GMT (1955 HKT) November 6, 2017
This is the first year the Next Gen ATP FInals is being held.
Next Gen ATP Finals held in Milan
Involves world's top under-21 singles players
Tournament runs from 7 to 11 November
It is a ceremony which has been branded ""awful"" and ""sexist"" and criticized for taking tennis ""back to zero.""
Much to the dismay of many on social media, some of the sport's leading young players taking part in this week's Next Gen ATP Finals in Milan were on Sunday forced to choose a female model, who had the letter 'A' or 'B' hidden on her body, to determine the round-robin group they would play in at the tournament.
The players were then escorted down a catwalk, arm-in-arm with the model, who would reveal the letter -- which corresponded to the round-robin group -- to the audience and cameras.
French tennis player Alize Cornet tweeted: ""Good job ATP World Tour. Supposed to be a futurist event right? #backtozero.""
Also on Twitter, tennis coach Judy Murray, who is the mum of former world No.1 Andy Murray, described the ceremony as ""awful.""
Russia's Daniil Medvedev walks down the catwalk at the Next Gen Finals draw ceremony.
journalist Reem Abulleil, who was at the draw ceremony, wrote: ""There was inappropriate dancing, gloves that were removed by a player's teeth, and many more cringe-worthy moments but I'll spare you the details.
""Most of the players looked visibly awkward, while some laughed their way through it. I personally felt deeply sad watching it all unfold.""
The ATP was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNN.
The ATP NextGen Milan draw ceremony made players select models to determine their groups. Stunningly uncomfortable, cringeworthy and trashy.
— Ben Rothenberg (@BenRothenberg)
The inaugural Next Gen competition is an eight-man event featuring seven of the world's top Under-21 players and an Italian wild card.
It features two round-robin groups. In Group A are Andrey Rublev, Denis Shapovalov, Hyeon Chung and Gianluigi Quinzi, while Karen Khachanov, Borna Coric, Jared Donaldson and Daniil Medvedev make up Group B.
The top two from each will progress to the semifinals, with the final, which takes place on November 11, determining the best young player in the world.
The winner will take home around $1.2 million in prize money.
Sports such as cycling, motorsport and boxing have often been criticized for the presence of female models in podium ceremonies and pre-fight weigh-ins.
Organizers of cycling's Vuelta a Espana replaced podium girls with ""elegantly dressed"" men and women for the 2017 race, following in the footsteps of the Tour Down Under and the Volta a Catalunya which ended the tradition of having women presenting prizes to the winning riders on the podium.
However, Slovakian cyclist Peter Sagan had to apologize after pinching the bottom of a hostess at the end of the Tour de Flanders in 2013.
Last year British cycling was embroiled in a sexism row after track cyclist Jess Varnish said the sport's chiefs had told her she was ""too old"" and that she should ""go and have a baby"" after she was dropped from the Olympic squad.

"Superstars plan next career with Harvard course
Katie Holmes is among the famous names signing up as students for the Harvard course
The football superstar, the actress and the rapper walk into a classroom.
This is not the set-up for a joke, but a four-day executive education course held at Harvard Business School in the United States last month.
Among the students taking the Business of Sport, Media and Entertainment course were Barcelona defender Gerard Pique, actress Katie Holmes and Irish rugby union player Jamie Heaslip.
Rapper LL Cool J is another former graduate.
""Many of the participants want to know how to monetise their brand and build a business around it, to launch a second career after their current one is over, or to enter new careers,"" says course leader Professor Anita Elberse.
Prof Elberse's job might sound like a teacher's worst nightmare.
Celebrities are not used to being told what to do - or that they have got something wrong.
But she insists none of them receives special treatment.
Get me a raise: Prof Elberse with actress Katie Holmes and sports stars CJ McCollum, Gerard Pique, Rashean Mathis and Jamie Heaslip
""They know that if they say something that makes no sense, then I or someone else in the class will tell them they are wrong,"" she says.
""This might actually be quite refreshing for them and one of the reasons they enjoy the course so much.""
During the course, they eat meals together and sleep in the Harvard dormitories.
When a celebrity applies to the course, Prof Elberse often phones them up to make sure they know what to expect.
""So far all of them have been very engaged,"" she says. ""I have not been disappointed.""
The reason so many big names from sports and entertainment apply for the course is to capitalise on the growing importance of individual superstar brands in these fields.
The trend was identified by Prof Elberse in her book, Blockbusters.
She argues that building a business around ""blockbuster products"" - a small number of high impact, big investment films, TV shows, books or star names - is ""the surest path to long-term success"".
Barcelona and Real Madrid football clubs are claimed as examples - gaining sporting and commercial success by spending a large proportion of their budgets on a few stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar Jr.
The rise of the superstar has been accelerated by social media, which allows individuals to connect directly with fans, rather than work through publishers or agents.
Rapper LL Cool J has been a fan of the course at Harvard
Irish rugby union player Jamie Heaslip might have been setting off for New Zealand with the Lions tour last month, but a serious injury in March meant he had time to attend this year's course.
He hopes to apply what he learned to his own sport.
""I was fascinated by the blockbuster theory and how it can be implemented in rugby, which has only been professional for 20 years, so is a relatively young sport in that sense,"" he says.
""We looked at how other sports have sold themselves as entertainment products, and how everyone involved in a sport is a stakeholder who can have a role in growing the game.""
""I had some interesting discussions with [basketball player] C.J. McCollum about the differences between the business side of rugby and the NBA.""
He says he would be interested in working to grow rugby in new markets after he retires from playing.
Prof Elberse's course could have an impact on the future of sport and entertainment, if her students go on to become leaders in these industries.
Gerard Pique has been suggested as a future president of Barcelona. Will he apply the blockbuster theory to running the Spanish club?
""I don't know, but I told him if he's president then I insist on being vice-president,"" she says.
The course is taught using Harvard Business School's case study method. Students look at 10 recent examples of success and failure in the sports, entertainment and music industries.
These include Beyonce's gamble to release an album in 2013 without any prior marketing and promotion, and the decision by a production company to sell the TV series House of Cards to Netflix rather than a traditional TV network in 2011.
Students are divided into small groups to discuss the case studies, then the groups present their findings to the rest of the class.
""I ask questions and hope they come up with the answers, and I provide models for how they can think about or frame the discussion,"" says Prof Elberse, who also teaches the MBA at Harvard Business School.
Jamie Heaslip has an undergraduate degree in medical engineering and a master's in business. He says the case study method was ""very different to what I've experienced in my own education"" but ""very insightful"".
Prof Elberse has developed a theory of high impact ""blockbuster"" successes
This was partly because of the backgrounds of his fellow students - only 10 were from the ""talent"" side of sport and entertainment and the rest were from the management and business side.
""There were high-up executives running TV companies and studios in the room so it was really interesting to get their perspective,"" he says.
The course costs $10,000 (£7,700) per head and no prior educational qualifications are required.
With around 60 students attending each year, cynics could say that it is an easy source of income for Harvard.
Prof Dan Sarofian-Butin, founding dean of the school of education and social policy at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, says the course trades on Harvard's prestige.
""People can say they went to Harvard with other really cool and fancy students and were taught by a famous professor,"" he says.
He says students on executive education courses are already ""insiders"" who may know more about their industries than a professor.
But he says they can still benefit if the teacher is able to help them gain new insights.
""This is what a good teacher can bring to the table - the ability to point things out that are obvious, but only once you are able to see the bigger picture,"" he says.

"Uber clears way for huge Softbank investment
Uber's directors approved a huge investment from Japan's Softbank late Tuesday, and a series of changes to its board.
The firm said the investment, which reports suggest may hit $1.3bn (£980m), could be finalised in the coming weeks.
The board of the ride-sharing firm also endorsed a plan to hold an initial public offering in 2019.
The moves signal fresh unity among the previously divided board as Uber seeks to recover from a series of scandals.
""The board voted unanimously to move forward with the proposed investment by Softbank and with governance changes that would strengthen its independence and ensure equality among all shareholders,"" Uber said in a statement late Tuesday.
The size of the investment is expected to be between $1bn (£750m) and $1.25bn (£940m), various reports said citing unnamed sources.

World Cup: Syria seek historic qualification, Lionel Messi's Argentina on the brink
Updated 1007 GMT (1807 HKT) October 4, 2017
The Sri Lankan capital of Colombo was the unlikely location for the start of the 2018 World Cup qualifiers which, after more than two and a half years, begin to draw to a close.
On March 12, 2015 Sri Lanka were beaten 1-0 on home soil by Bhutan in a match that garnered little attention outside of the island nation, but events in this week's qualifiers could have huge ramifications for Russia 2018.
CNN Sport takes a look at some of the main talking points from across the world in the upcoming qualifiers.
Eight of the 32 places up for grabs at the World Cup have been claimed:
Who else can qualify and who is on the brink of missing out?

Syria has further to travel for the ""home"" leg of their Asian qualifier than opponents Australia.
With the country ravaged by the ongoing civil war --
-- the ""Qasioun Eagles"" have been forced to play their recent home qualifiers 4,500 miles away in Malaysia.
After Macau refused to continue hosting Syria's home matches, FIFA looked set to throw them out of World Cup qualifying, before Malaysia stepped in at the final hour.
Having never before featured at the World Cup, Syria's hopes were kept alive thanks to Omar Al Somah's 92nd minute equalizer against Iran in the final game of the group stages, which secured third place and a play-off against Australia.
The winner of the tie, played over two legs, will play one final qualifier against a team from the CONCACAF region for a place at Russia 2018.
It's not out of the question that Syria could upset an Australia side that has failed to impress throughout qualifying and looks to have stagnated under coach Ange Postecoglou since the 2014 World Cup.
Though not everyone in Syria sees the national team's rise as an uplifting, against all odds story. Many argue Bashar al-Assad and his regime are using the success to portray a false positive image of the country given the civil war.
Syria's football team still dreaming of 2018 World Cup
Syria's football team still dreaming of 2018 World Cup
So accustomed to relentless success with Barcelona over the years, Lionel Messi has been made to suffer on the international stage with Argentina.
On the end of three successive defeats in major finals -- World Cup 2014, Copa America 2015 and Copa America 2016 -- doubts continue to linger about Messi's ability to produce on the international stage.
The third of those losses -- and the second in two years against Chile -- caused Messi to announce his retirement from international football, though he did promptly reverse his decision in an attempt to help a struggling Argentina qualify for the World Cup.
His return, however, didn't spark a slumbering Albiceleste to life. Soon after a man of the match display in his first game back -- a 3-0 win over Colombia which proved to be a false dawn -- Messi led the national team in a boycott of the Argentine media.
A few months later, in a home victory over Chile, Messi was banned for four games for verbally abusing an assistant referee, though that ban was overturned after the Barcelona star had already served one match of the suspension.
Messi shows his dejection after being defeated by Chile in the 2016 Copa America final.
It's a sign of the instability of the Argentina team that it's had three coaches during these qualifiers.
Gerardo Martino, who led Argentina to successive Copa America final defeats, was succeeded by Edgardo Bauza.
A string of poor results, coupled with Jorge Sampaoli's availability at the end of the season with Sevilla, saw Bauza leave his post and finally allow the 57-year-old former Chile coach to take his dream job.
Argentina's remaining make or break fixtures come at home to Peru, South America's in-form side, and away to Ecuador in the altitude of Quito.
Thursday's match against Peru will be played at Boca Juniors' Bombonera stadium in Buenos Aires rather than their traditional venue of the Monumental stadium, which is home to Boca's rivals River Plate.
The Bombonera is famed for its raucous atmosphere, though it was also where Peru drew 2-2 with Argentina in a World Cup qualifier in 1969 to ensure the Albiceleste wouldn't go to the 1970 tournament.
I never saw such disappointment in a dressing room; several of my team-mates were crying and Adolfo Pedernera [Argentina's coach] was sat silently in a corner smoking,"" Argentine player Alberto Rendo, told FIFA.com.
Boca Juniors' Bombonera stadium is the venue for Argentina's game against Peru.
Such is the magnitude of the upcoming fixture, Peru coach Ricardo Gareca has reportedly requested a police presence on the rooftops around his training camp to deter Argentine spies.
""I'd prefer to play World Cup Finals than deciders like the one against Peru,"" Argentina's general manager Jorge Burruchaga, who played in a World Cup qualifier against Peru in 1995, told FIFA.com.
That game ended in a 2-2 draw with Argentina qualifying for Mexico 1986, while Peru went to the play-offs, where they lost to Chile.
""It was a very stressful occasion, whereas the finals I played in Mexico and Italy were very happy occasions because you knew you were close to achieving something great,"" added Burruchaga.
Nigeria remain on course to qualify for a third successive World Cup, a feat they have achieved only once before in their history.
Currently sitting top of Group B, a home victory against nearest rivals Zambia -- who sit just three points behind -- would guarantee qualification to Russia 2018.
Jay-Jay Okocha on PSG, Neymar and Cavani

In the same group, meanwhile, Algeria -- who impressed at the 2014 World Cup and almost knocked out eventual champions Germany -- are bottom with one point from four games, prompting fans to ask: how did it all go so wrong?
In Group E, neutral's favorites Uganda are still in with a chance of qualifying for a first ever World Cup. The Cranes, under Serbian coach Milutin Sredojević,
Though they were eliminated in the group stages, the country has carried that momentum forward and sits in second place behind powerhouses Egypt, despite unrest in the Ugandan FA.
Sredojević terminated his contract in July over unpaid wages -- though the FA insist the $54,000 he is owed will be paid -- and local coaches Moses Basena and Fred Kajoba were brought in to lead the team through qualifying.

Uganda face a huge home match against third place Ghana, while leaders Egypt welcome Congo.
Four years after the US delivered Panama their most painful blow, Los Canaleros are out for revenge.
In 2013, with just two minutes remaining on the clock, Panama led an already qualified US Men's National Team 1-0 in the final game of CONCACAF's Hexagonal qualifier.
Victory would have sent Panama through to an intercontinental play-off against New Zealand and knocked Mexico out altogether.
With a first ever World Cup appearance within their grasp, the US scored two goals in stoppage to cruelly snatch it away from Panama and allow Mexico to qualify through the play-offs.
The last-gasp victory prompted one of football commentary's most memorable outbursts.
""We love you,"" cried the Mexican commentator. ""We love you forever and ever. God bless America!""
This time around, a Panama victory on US soil would guarantee them a place in Russia next year and consign the USMNT to the intercontinental play-off -- although they risk missing out altogether should other results go against them.

Messi isn't the only international household name which could miss out on Russia 2018.
Despite boasting the considerable talents of Arjen Robben, Daley Blind and Kevin Strootman, the Netherlands -- still reeling from a failure to qualify for Euro 2016 -- could yet miss out on successive international tournaments.
Currently third in Group A, three points behind Sweden who sit in the play-off place, the Oranje face a must-win trip to Belarus before welcoming Sweden in what could be the decisive fixture of the group.
Meanwhile, Wales' World Cup hopes were dealt a considerable blow with the news talisman Gareth Bale would miss the final two qualifiers through injury.
Sitting precariously in second place in Group D, Wales need victories over Georgia and Ireland -- who are lurking just a point behind -- to ensure the Real Madrid star doesn't miss out on the World Cup.

"Theresa May aims to eradicate plastic litter by 2042
Sea birds have struggled to cope with plastic pollution
Theresa May will pledge to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042.
The commitment is part of a 25-year plan to improve the natural environment being launched on Thursday.
In her speech to launch the plan the prime minister will say: ""I think people will be shocked at how today we allow so much plastic to be produced needlessly.""
But green groups are angry the proposals will have no legal force.
They say the plans could simply be shelved if they become inconvenient and the promise to stop ""avoidable"" plastic waste is too vague.
Labour suggested the proposals were a ""cynical attempt at rebranding the Tories' image"" while the Liberal Democrats said it ""beggared belief"" that a 24-year target had been set for removing plastic waste and that action was needed now.
Under the plan, supermarkets will be urged to introduce ""plastic-free"" aisles while taxes and charges on single-use items such as takeaway containers will be considered.
Mrs May's announcements, which have been agreed by cabinet, will also include:
Confirmation of the extension of the 5p charge for plastic carrier bags to all retailers in England
Government funding for plastics innovation
A commitment to help developing nations tackle pollution and reduce plastic waste, including through UK aid
In her speech, Mrs May is expected to say: ""We look back in horror at some of the damage done to our environment in the past and wonder how anyone could have thought that, for example, dumping toxic chemicals into rivers was ever the right thing to do.""
She will call plastic waste ""one of the great environmental scourges of our time"".
She will say: ""In the UK alone, the amount of single-use plastic wasted every year would fill 1,000 Royal Albert Halls.""
Meanwhile, plans to help more children engage with the environment will include Â£10m for school visits and a programme to create school grounds that allow youngsters to learn more about the natural world.
Mrs May will say she will put the oceans firmly on the agenda of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in April.
Many wildflower meadows have been destroyed
Thursday's announcements will be the culmination of an environmental week for the government. On Sunday, Mrs May promised a clampdown on plastic waste. On Wednesday, plans emerged to extend the 5p plastic bag charge to include corner shops in England.
Ministers have been under political pressure to do more for the environment after it was identified by the Tory think-tank Bright Blue as the key issue for young voters, who failed to back the party in large numbers at the 2017 general election.
Environmentalists agree that the government's plan to restore nature - not just safeguard nature - is genuinely radical.
Many of the UK's landscapes have been ravaged by development, intensive farming and sheep grazing. Only 2% of wildflower meadows have survived.
I understand that the document will cover many policy areas, including: managing land sustainably; enhancing nature and recovering wildlife; increasing people's health and well-being through nature; resource efficiency, reduction of pollution and waste and protecting and improving the global environment.
But there is scepticism about how far the environment department Defra will be able to carry out its plans.
There are huge pressures on the natural world from urgently needed house-building; HS2 threatens scores of ancient woodlands; and the Department for Transport has a major road-building programme.
Greenpeace said Mrs May's announcement was a ""missed opportunity"" and while the focus on plastic waste solutions was welcome, the plan ""lacked urgency, detail and bite"".
The campaign group questioned why there was no mention of deposit return schemes which it said were a ""tried-and-tested"" way of keeping bottles out of the natural environment and were popular with the public.
Craig Bennett, head of Friends of the Earth, said it welcomed any moves to restore the natural world, including landscapes and wildlife.
""But we need a clear timetable of short-term delivery of schemes, not just woolly promises of doing something good in the future,"" he addded.
""It's nice seeing ministers hug trees - but why are they continuing with unpopular fracking when we've already found more fossil fuels than we can be allowed to burn if we want a stable climate?""
Tom Burke, from the green think-tank e3g, welcomed many elements of the plan, but said: ""There are lots of things this plan doesn't deal with. [The government's] being taken to court for the third time over illegal levels of air pollution.""
Stephanie Hilborne from the Wildlife Trusts said: ""This plan looks good in many ways, but it has no legal under-pinning so it could completely disappear.""

"Three customers can now stream without losing data
Three has become the first network provider in the UK to launch a tariff that lets customers use unlimited streaming services.
Suitably named Go Binge, the deal allows Three customers to watch sites like Netflix without it affecting their monthly data allowance.
And Netflix isn't the only streaming service included in the plan.
Music streaming sites like Deezer and SoundCloud are also on board. But it's only available on certain tariffs.
Normally, streaming can quickly eat into your data allowance, if you haven't got an unlimited deal.

, Three's CEO David Dyson said Three's customers are some of the most data-heavy users in Britain, using 6GB of data a month on average.
""It's clear they love to watch and listen to many forms of content,"" he said.
""The devices and networks have enabled people to watch when and where they wish, instead of being confined to their homes.""
""People can make the most of their 'down time' whether that's on a commute, in a park or even on the toilet,"" the CEO added.

"Star Wars: 'It's time for a female or non-white director'
Rian Johnson (far right) with 10 cast members - plus BB-8 - from The Last Jedi
The director of the latest Star Wars movie has said it's time an episode in the series was entrusted to a female and/or non-white film-maker.
""Hell yes it's time,"" said Rian Johnson at a press conference for Star Wars: The Last Jedi in central London.
""There are so many incredibly talented female directors, directors of colour out there, and so many that I would love to see play in this universe.""
Every Star Wars director from George Lucas on has been a white man.
The Last Jedi and its predecessor, 2015's The Force Awakens, have been praised for having a female lead character and an ethnically diverse cast.
Yet the director's chair has remained an all-male preserve, despite the woman in charge of the series - Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy - expressing a desire for it to have a female occupant ""
Star Wars directors to date
George Lucas (A New Hope, The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith)
Irvin Kershner (The Empire Strikes Back)
Richard Marquand (Return of the Jedi)
JJ Abrams (The Force Awakens, Episode IX)
Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story)
Rian Johnson (The Last Jedi)
Ron Howard (Solo: A Star Wars Story)
New additions to the Star Wars ensemble in The Last Jedi include Puerto Rican actor Benicio Del Toro and Kelly Marie Tran, the first Asian-American actress to have a lead role in the series.
Tran, 28, said she ""felt at home"" on the set despite being ""this complete new person"", adding that she would be ""reliving those moments we had on set for the rest of my life in my mind"".
Star power: Princes turn out for Star Wars premiere
Rian Johnson, whose previous films include Brick and Looper, said it ""felt good"" for the franchise ""to reflect the world a little more closely as it is today and how it looks around us"".
Yet he promised this would not extend to taking the series to Earth. He's been invited to create a new Star Wars trilogy once the current trilogy concludes in 2019.
""In so far as it is within my power, I solemnly promise that Luke Skywalker will never fade up into modern-day New York, even though it would be a really funny fish-out-of-water story,"" he joked.
Kelly Marie Tran said she struggled not to cry when remembering her time on set
In The Last Jedi, Daisy Ridley's character Rey is seen seeking tutelage from Luke, who is discovered living a reclusive existence on a remote planet called Ahch-To.
Her story unfolds in tandem with those of Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac), who are tasked with stopping the Resistance from being wiped out by the evil First Order.
Mark Hamill, who plays an ageing Luke, expressed admiration for the film's younger cast members while admitting some disquiet over their roles in the film.
""I had to fight the irrational urge that it's a bunch of strangers rummaging through my old toy box playing with my toys,"" said the actor, who turned 66 in September.
""But basically at this age I'm happy to let the kids do the heavy lifting.""
Hamill (right) had a small role in The Force Awakens but plays a larger part in its follow-up
The Star Wars franchise is one of the crown jewels of the Disney empire, which bought George Lucas's production company in 2012 for $4.05bn (Â£3bn).
It's fitting, then, that The Last Jedi should come with a royal seal of approval from Princes William and Harry,
that the royals had shot a scene in which they were disguised as stormtroopers, the helmet-wearing soldiers of the film's villain.
Johnson, though, told reporters he could ""neither confirm nor deny"" such a scene was filmed, or whether William and Harry had made it into the final edit.
This was despite Boyega claiming on TV earlier in the day that the scene had been axed and that he had personally apologised to the princes at Tuesday night's premiere.
Speaking at Wednesday's press conference, Ridley admitted she hadn't found showing the royals around the Pinewood set an entirely comfortable experience.
Princes Harry and William had a mock-lightsaber battle during their visit
""I'm not great at small talk, so I found it a bit awkward at the beginning to be honest,"" said the 25-year-old,
in Sir Kenneth Branagh's Murder on the Orient Express.
Hamill, meanwhile, said he had sought guidance from the royal siblings on whether Luke, whom he first played in the original Star Wars film in 1977, was also a royal.
""When I met the princes, I said, 'I really want your opinion on this,'"" he recalled. ""I said, 'My mother was Queen Amidala, my father was Lord Vader, my sister is Princess Leia. Doesn't that make me royalty?'
""Unfortunately it was a split decision, because William said yes and Harry said, 'I need more information.'""
Domhnall Gleeson, son of Brendan, plays the sinister General Hux
Leia, of course, is played by the late Carrie Fisher,
shortly after completing her work on the new film.
""Carrie was first and foremost a writer and that's how we first really connected,"" said Johnson.
""I feel really lucky to have had even just a little bit of time to get to know her.""
Cast member Domhnall Gleeson, meanwhile, said Fisher had been ""really generous"" with her time and ""amazingly big-hearted"".
""Nobody knew what was going to happen with Carrie, obviously, and I love that Rian wrote her a beautiful film,"" the Irish actor said.
Star Wars: The Last Jedi can be seen in UK cinemas from 00:01 on Thursday.

"JAY-Z's digital-only album goes platinum in under a week
American hip-hop star JAY-Z with Recording Industry Association of America CEO Cary Sherman
JAY-Z's digital-only album 4:44 has gone platinum within five days - despite limits on who could access it.
The music was only available on Tidal, the star's own streaming service, and to customers of US mobile firm Sprint.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) platinum certification, which requires more than one million sales, is rare for digital-only albums.
The RIAA only started counting digital streams last year, with 1,500 plays considered equal to one album sale.
Sprint was a significant contributor to 4:44's early success, giving away large numbers of the album to its users for free.
The firm is a major shareholder in Tidal, which launched in March 2015.
It is not the first time JAY-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, has partnered with a phone company to generate a sales splash.
His 2013 limited-release album Magna Carta Holy Grail, which was initially only made available to some Samsung users, also went platinum.
JAY-Z has generated a lot of buzz with his latest album, which has ten songs and appears to confirm that his
Fans are speculating that elsewhere on the album, JAY-Z responds to Beyonce's Lemonade album and apologises for cheating.
The American rapper has been looking to translate his chart success to his music streaming venture Tidal.
JAY-Z has had 13 solo platinum albums, which his label Roc Nation says is more than any other hip-hop artist.
Last year Tidal said it had three million subscribers but some have questioned the accuracy of those numbers.
Spotify, which now has more than 140 million active monthly users, remains the market leader but has yet to turn a profit.
The number of subscribers paying for its premium service, which does not have advertising, rose by 20 million in 2016 to 48 million.
Apple Music, a key competitor, has doubled its number of subscribers over the last year to 27 million. Unlike Spotify it does not offer a free tier.

"Hollywood holds #MeToo march against sexual harassment
The march was led by Tarana Burke, who started the #MeToo hashtag (centre)
Hundreds of people have marched in Hollywood in support of victims of sexual assault and harassment, inspired by the #MeToo social media campaign.
The march follows a torrent of assault and harassment allegations against public figures, set off by revelations about the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.
The marchers started on Hollywood Boulevard and walked along the ""Walk of Fame"" to CNN's headquarters.
They were predominantly women but many men attended.
Tara McNamarra, 21, of Los Angeles, told Reuters news agency that the march felt cleansing after years of not being taken seriously about abuse.
""I've been sexually assaulted multiple times throughout my life,"" she said. ""It's affected me in every aspect of my life.""
Marchers hold placards on Hollywood's Walk of Fame on Sunday
The #MeToo hashtag was first used by social activist Tarana Burke and popularised by actress Alyssa Milano in the wake of the Weinstein allegations.
Ms Burke led Sunday's march. ""For every Harvey Weinstein, there's a hundred more men in the neighborhood who are doing the exact same thing,"" she wrote on Facebook ahead of the event.
""What we're seeing, at least for now, is a unity of survivors, a community of survivors that have grown out of this #MeToo viral moment, that I'm just hoping and praying that we can sustain.""
The actor Kevin Spacey and comedian Louis CK are among the high-profile figures accused of sexual harassment over the past few weeks.
on Friday, admitting after years of denials that the allegations were true.
""The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly,"" he wrote.
The New York Times reported in October that Weinstein, 65, had settled out of court with eight women who had accused him of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact.
Weinstein has also been accused of rape, but said through a spokesperson that he ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual sex.

"What do people in Dunkirk make of the film Dunkirk?
Dunkirk tells of British and Allied troops trapped on a beach surrounded by enemy forces in 1940
Christopher Nolan's film about British, French and Belgian troops fleeing the beaches and harbour at Dunkirk, in Operation Dynamo, in 1940, has been this summer's box-office hit - in the UK, in America and in France. But what do the people who live in the northern French seaside town itself think about it?
In a steel shipping container in a park in the Dunkirk suburb of Malo-les-Bains, there's a temporary exhibition with text, photographs and a slideshow telling the story of Operation Dynamo, and of the making of the film Dunkirk.
In May 1940, with the north-east corner of France cut-off by Hitler's army, 400,000 soldiers waited on the beaches for ships to take them to England - 200,000 British troops, 130,000 French and about 10,000 Belgians made it to safety, 60,000 did not.
In the first week of its release, 15,000 people saw the film in Dunkirk
Operation Dynamo was a coordinated effort by naval ships, pleasure steamers from British seaside resorts - and small motor yachts, most of which had been commandeered by the Royal Navy for the evacuation.
These ""little ships"", as they came to be known, had such shallow draught they were able to cross the sandbanks off Dunkirk and shuttle troops off the beach to larger ships anchored in deep water offshore.
Most of the buildings in Dunkirk were destroyed by wartime bombardment, so the street scenes in the film were shot in Malo-les-Bains.
In that shipping container in the park, I met three young boys who had dropped their bikes on to the grass outside to go in and watch the slideshow about the making of the film.
One of them had seen the film - ""It's very good"" - and all three knew about the little ships.
Gael, Theo and Mael at a slideshow about the making of the film
Theo, Gael and Mael - aged between 11 and 13 - answered me almost in unison when I asked why the little ships were important.
""For Operation Dynamo - to get the soldiers off the beach and take them to England,"" they said.
In the first week of its release, 15,000 people saw the film on one of Dunkirk's three main screens, and it was showing at two other cinemas in the town.
Across France, nearly a million watched it over the same period, making it the box-office number one.
There are posters and banners advertising the film all over Dunkirk, and banners recalling Operation Dynamo.
A telephone engineer and keen reader of World War Two history, Evrard Sebastien, offered a mixed review of the movie.
""It's an average film,"" he said. ""It won't win any Oscars. It was a good idea to make it, but I was disappointed.
""The action sequences with the ships and the planes are very well done.""
But, he added: ""There are many missing details. There are hardly any French soldiers in it. And it was thanks to them to a significant extent that the British were able to evacuate at all.""
In 1940, 340,000 British, French and Belgian troops escaped from the beaches and harbour at Dunkirk - but 60,000 did not make it
For example, a seldom mentioned detail is that about 40,000 men in the French First Army delayed German progress towards Dunkirk from Lille, 80km (50 miles) to the south, where they eventually ran out of food and ammunition and were forced to surrender.
Gregory and Juliette Lefevre - she is a secondary school teacher, he sells industrial equipment - were more enthusiastic about the film: ""Very good, very emotional. We really like it. Fantastic film.""
But they too were concerned that there was barely any reference to the French in the film.
Another Dunkirk woman who had seen the film, Isabelle Denele, said there was still a strong seam of gratitude in the town for Operation Dynamo.
She said: ""The British had the courage to come and rescue their compatriots - that was magnificent. And, happily, the English were there to help us.
""And it's an effective film for me because my parents were here.
""They lived in Dunkirk at the time of the evacuation and then lived under Nazi occupation.
""My parents had to learn German. They're in their 90s now, and they can still speak German, and they don't like it.
""My parents, my grandparents, were marked by that war. They lost a lot of friends. Dunkirk suffered a lot in that war.""
Her husband, Bruno, expressed his gratitude with an unexpected comment about the revered French wartime leader in exile in London, who later became French president - Gen Charles de Gaulle.
Bruno believes the Dunkirk evacuation - inspired by the British wartime leader Winston Churchill - was an essential precursor to the D-Day landings four years later, which helped to save France from the Nazis.
""De Gaulle would have been nothing without Churchill,"" he said.
On the blustery July day that I visited the beach at Dunkirk, it was almost silent - and mostly deserted apart from some dog walkers and a few children making sandcastles.
Out to sea, sailing boats glided along - their sails sharply white against dark clouds in the distance - a peaceful scene, where it was hard to imagine the terror on this Dunkirk beach 77 years ago when 400,000 troops were under bombardment by German planes as they lined up to board ships to take them to safety.

"Malaysia Airlines to track planes with satellites
Malaysia Airlines has become the first carrier to sign up to a new satellite flight tracking system for its fleet.
It comes three years after its MH370 flight bound for Beijing disappeared with 239 people on board.
Using a soon-to-be-launched satellite network, the airline will be able to monitor its planes in areas where there is currently no surveillance.
They include polar regions and remote areas of oceans not covered by existing systems.
The airline reached a deal for the service provided by US-based Aireon, FlightAware and SITAONAIR.
The new system can also provide more regular updates on a plane's location, especially when travelling over oceans and other remote areas, said SITAONAIR's portfolio director Paul Gibson.
Aircrafts deviating from a flight path could be identified more quickly as a result, he said.
""With access to up-to-the-minute reporting, Malaysia Airlines will know the location, heading, speed and altitude of all aircraft in its fleet, at all times, and be alerted to any exceptions.""
But it is unclear if the additional tracking ability would have had any impact on the MH370 disappearance.
All tracking systems monitor a plane's location using its on-board transmitter. When the Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight vanished in March 2014, the transmitter signal was lost, with some suspicions it was done deliberately.
Most flights currently transmit their position using signals tracked from both the ground and space.
The new service, available in 2018, will add to that coverage, using the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation which was launched earlier this year.
The fate of MH370 remains one of the world's greatest aviation mystery. More than 120,000 sq km (46,300 miles) of the Indian Ocean has been searched with no sign of the aircraft.
Some pieces of debris have been found on African islands including Madagascar.
The deep-water search for the flight was called off earlier this year.
Malaysian Airlines has been trying to win back customers' confidence, by offering travel discounts and flight promotions.
The carrier's chief operating officer, Izham Ismail, said the firm was ""proud"" to be the first airline to sign up for the system.

"David Cassidy: Partridge Family star dies aged 67
The singer shot to fame in the 1970s
US actor and singer David Cassidy, who found fame in The Partridge Family before going on to become a 1970s pop idol, has died aged 67.
""David died surrounded by those he loved, with joy in his heart and free from the pain that had gripped him for so long,"" a family statement said.
He was admitted to hospital last week after suffering multiple organ failure.
and would stop touring in order to ""enjoy life"".
Cassidy shot to fame playing Keith Partridge in The Partridge Family - a 1970s sitcom about a mother and five children who formed a rock and roll band.
The show spawned several hit songs, such as I Think I Love You.
In recent years he has spoken about his struggles with alcohol.
In 2015 he filed for bankruptcy. Between 2010 and 2014, he was arrested three times for drunken driving, and was ordered to rehab as part of his sentence in 2014. He has divorced three times.

"First monkey clones created in Chinese laboratory
Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua are being bottle fed and are growing normally
Two monkeys have been cloned using the technique that produced Dolly the Sheep.
Identical long-tailed macaques Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua were born several weeks ago at a laboratory in China.
Scientists say populations of monkeys that are genetically identical will be useful for research into human diseases.
But critics say the work raises ethical concerns by bringing the world closer to human cloning.
Qiang Sun of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience said the cloned monkeys will be useful as a model for studying diseases with a genetic basis, including some cancers, metabolic and immune disorders.
""There are a lot of questions about primate biology that can be studied by having this additional model,"" he said.
Zhong Zhong was born eight weeks ago and is named after the word for Chinese nation or people. Hua Hua was born six weeks ago.
The researchers say the monkeys are being bottle fed and are currently growing normally. They expect more macaque clones to be born over the coming months.
Prof Robin Lovell-Badge of The Francis Crick Institute, London, said the technique used to clone Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua remains ""a very inefficient and hazardous procedure"".
""The work in this paper is not a stepping-stone to establishing methods for obtaining live born human clones,"" he said.
Prof Darren Griffin of the University of Kent said the approach may be useful in understanding human diseases, but raised ethical concerns.
Chinese Academy of Sciences
Zhong Zhong was created by somatic cell nuclear transfer
""Careful consideration now needs to be given to the ethical framework under which such experiments can, and should, operate,"" he said.
Dolly made history 20 years ago after being cloned at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh. It was the first time scientists had been able to clone a mammal from an adult cell, taken from the udder.
Since then many other mammals have been cloned using the same single cell nuclear transfer technique (SCNT), including cattle, pigs, dogs, cats, mice and rats. This involves transferring DNA from the nucleus of a cell to a donated egg cell that is then prompted to develop into an embryo.
Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua are the first non-human primates cloned through this technique.
In 1999, a rhesus monkey embryo was split in two in order to create two identical twins. One of the baby monkeys born through that technique - called Tetra - has the title of the world's first cloned monkey, but it did not involve the complex process of DNA transfer.
In the study, published in the journal, Cell, scientists used DNA from foetal connective tissue cells.
After the DNA was transferred to donated eggs, genetic reprogramming was used to alter genes that would otherwise have stopped the embryo developing.
Chinese Academy of Sciences
Hua Hua was born six weeks ago in a Shanghai lab
Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua were the result of 79 attempts. Two other monkeys were initially cloned from a different type of adult cell, but failed to survive.
Dr Sun said: ""We tried several different methods, but only one worked. There was much failure before we found a way to successfully clone a monkey.""
The scientists say they followed strict international guidelines for animal research, set by the US National Institutes of Health.
Co-researcher Dr Muming Poo, also of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai, said: ""We are very aware that future research using non-human primates anywhere in the world depends on scientists following very strict ethical standards.""

"'No decisive progress' on Brexit - Barnier
Europe's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says there has been ""no decisive progress"" on key issues in talks with the UK.
He said negotiations are still ""quite far"" away from being in a position to begin talks on future trade arrangements.
He also said there were issues of ""trust"" between the two sides.
But UK Brexit Secretary David Davis urged the EU to be ""more imaginative and flexible"" in its approach.

"'Everything's on fire' - the scramble to organise an election
When Theresa May announced on Tuesday she was seeking an early general election, scores of people saw their weekends and half-term holidays vanish in a giant puff of electioneering, manifesto-writing and the mammoth admin task of staging a nationwide ballot.
By anyone's estimations, the general election of 2015 was an immense piece of administration.
Forty-five million ballot papers were printed to reflect 650 separate candidate lists for the election. Forty-three thousand polling stations were staffed for 15 hours by 120,000 people. And the total cost of it came to Â£98,845,157.
But all that was organised with five years' notice - the duration between the previous election and the date of the 2015 poll.
The time frame for the 2017 ballot, which takes place on 8 June, is little more than seven weeks.
One Conservative member of staff told the BBC she was completely taken aback. ""I have friends who work for ministers and even they didn't see it coming until the Cabinet meeting took place.""
The clock is already ticking, and there is much work to be done. A Labour aide working for an MP described the past week as ""very stressful"".
""In my own time after work I've been contributing to campaign materials and arranging to uproot myself from London so I can go back to the constituency.""
While general elections are about putting MPs in Parliament, it falls to councils to organise the nitty-gritty of voting and counting.
Venues for polling stations and counting centres will need to be earmarked and reserved for 8 June. And that needs to happen before polling cards can be sent out.
Some of the 120,000 people employed to conduct the 2015 election
This work is carried out by local authorities' electoral services divisions and overseen by returning officers.
John Turner, chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, predicts this election will be particularly onerous for two reasons - the compressed time scale, and the fact local elections are already taking place in many areas in less than two weeks.
""Many polling stations aren't publicly owned,"" said Mr Turner. ""They're church halls or community centres, and a lot rests on returning officers' ability to persuade the owners to move things around and make the space available.""
As for staffing, electoral services departments maintain databases of temporary workers. But ""in this case some of them may already have made other plans or booked holidays"".
""Although returning officers are helped by permanent teams, this varies a lot. In some district councils it will only be two or three people and colleagues from other departments will have to pitch in.
Polling stations have to be organised
""It's going to be an intense time for many of us, working 12-hour days.""
Mr Turner is confident, however, that it will all come together in time, noting: ""We're a bit like the duck paddling away beneath the water but serene on the surface.""
There's equally little hope of sleep for those in charge of political policy making. They will be working around the clock on putting together manifestoes.
It's a particularly stressful time for the party in government, says Nick Pearce, head of the No 10 policy unit under former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. As well as existing government duties, staff will be working ""flat-out"" to get the document finalised.
""A minister, usually from the Cabinet Office, takes overall responsibility, working with political staff from different departments to draft sections and liaise with the prime minister and her chief of staff,"" he explained.
Ministers, lobbyists and Treasury staff also get heavily involved, trying to place pet projects and ensure big-ticket items are properly costed.
""There's huge pressure not to get anything wrong,"" said Mr Pearce. ""But working quickly like this there is certainly potential for that to happen.""
And what of getting the message out?
Seven weeks is ""a very, very tight time frame"" for organising a marketing and advertising strategy, said Rachel Hamburger, an advertising executive and former Lib Dem campaigner.
""I'd be very surprised if we saw any nationwide broadcast campaigns comparable to famous ones of the past such as the Blair 'devil eyes',"" she said.
""With a long run-up, parties could be expected to run focus groups, market research and analysis of what is most important to their campaign before deploying adverts.
This time, she believes. parties will ""concentrate resources on individual seats and simple messages"".
Elsewhere in the media, broadcasters are preparing for election night. The BBC is reassigning hundreds of researchers, producers, camera crews and local reporters to put together its results programme.
Parties, meanwhile, have to deal with the small matter of ensuring there are candidates in place in 650 constituencies for people to elect.
Labour and the Conservatives have both
, while all 54 of the SNP's existing MPs are expected to stand again.
David Dimbleby, left, will host the BBC's election night results programme
The other parties are in varying states of readiness.
The Lib Dems say they have about 100 candidates still to pick. UKIP and Plaid Cymru will adopt the bulk of their candidates next week, while Greens' selection is under way with local electoral alliances under consideration.
None of Northern Ireland's parties are thought to have selected candidates, as talks continue about restoring devolved government.
Most candidates will not have had a chance to allocate resources. It has already led some to take the unusual step of appealing for online donations.
Regional party offices will provide MPs and activists with support, but the prevailing mood could be described as one of apprehensiveness.
When asked to sum up how things were going, a fretful Conservative source said: ""Everything is basically on fire.""
A Labour campaigner replied with a series of distressed crying and screaming emojis.
However, on a purely technical point, it's worth noting the 50-day gap between announcement and polling day is actually the longest since 1983.
What's different this time is the lack of preamble, and thus preparation.
As the BBC's former head of political research David Cowling put it: ""Everyone was lulled into a false sense of security by assurances... and we're now completely stunned.""

Kilmer, pictured in 2013, said his swollen tongue was ""healing all the time""
Top Gun star Val Kilmer has appeared to confirm he had cancer, after previously claiming he had ""no cancer whatsoever"".
While answering questions put to him by Reddit users, the actor revealed he ""did have a healing of cancer"" and was still dealing with a swollen tongue.
""Because I don't sound my normal self yet people think I may still be under the weather,"" the 57-year-old wrote.
Speculation over Kilmer's health grew last year after Michael Douglas said he was ""dealing with"" throat cancer.

"Brexit: Theresa May to discuss end deal with ministers
Theresa May is due to meet her ""Brexit cabinet"" - about a dozen of her most senior ministers - to discuss for the first time what the UK's future relationship with the EU should be.
The PM will later tell MPs the UK wants to sign trade deals during what she calls an implementation period.
EU leaders have agreed talks can move on, including to discuss a transition deal for a post-Brexit period.
Labour has raised concerns that trade may not be discussed for months.
The EU has published its guidelines for phase two of the negotiations, with discussions on long-term future economic co-operation not likely to begin until March - although ""internal preparatory discussions"" on future relations can take place before then.
Mrs May will tell MPs that the guidelines point to the ""shared desire of the EU and the UK to make rapid progress on an implementation period"".
She will say during the temporary period the UK would ""not be in the single market or the customs union"".
But the UK would propose ""that our access to one another's markets would continue as now, while we prepare and implement the new processes and new systems that will underpin our future partnership"".
One suggestion for a future deal, from the centre left think tank the IPPR, is a so-called ""
It would see the UK and EU continuing the regulatory alignment that exists today, and the formation of a new customs union similar to the existing one.
The group believes that such a model would aim to keep the benefits of single market while allowing divergence from EU rules over time.
However, Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, has said there was ""no way"" the UK will secure a bespoke deal with the EU.
to ""accommodate their wishes"".
On Monday, Ms May will tell MPs: ""We will prepare for our future independent trade policy by negotiating - and where possible signing - trade deals with third countries, which could come into force after the conclusion of the implementation period.""
Labour's shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner has said it would be a ""real problem"" for business if the EU did not start talking about trade until March.
He has also said Labour would not put a time limit on a post-Brexit transition phase, because the expected two-year period would be ""extremely tight"".
Writing in two of the Sunday newspapers over the weekend,
she would ""not be derailed"" from securing an ""ambitious"" deal.
when MPs - including 11 from her own party - voted to give Parliament a legal guarantee of a vote on the final Brexit deal struck with Brussels.

"Japan's man in UK says unprofitable firms could not stay
Koji Tsuruoka, outside Downing Street, says the stakes are high
Japan's ambassador to the UK has said Brexit is a high stakes issue and that no company would be able to stay in the UK if it was not profitable.
Koji Tsuruoka was speaking outside Number 10 after a meeting between Prime Minister Theresa May and 19 top Japanese bosses.
Mrs May had told the business leaders that Brexit would allow the UK to strike a free trade deal with Japan.
She said the government's industrial strategy made the UK ""more attractive"".
However, Mr Tsuruoka told journalists: ""If there is no profitability of continuing operations in the UK - not Japanese only - no private company can continue operations. So it is as simple as that.""
He was asked about the threat to Japanese companies if the UK did not secure a frictionless trade deal.
""This is all high stakes that all of us, I think, need to keep in mind,"" he answered.
During the meeting Mrs May told attendees from companies including Mitsubishi, Honda, Nissan, Toyota and Panasonic that Brexit was ""no small undertaking"".
She also said the government's modern industrial strategy made the UK ""more attractive"".
""Just today we have seen the Bank of England raise its forecast for UK growth compared with its estimates three months ago,"" Mrs May added.

Chancellor Phillip Hammond, Business Secretary Greg Clark and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox were also at the meeting.
""I recognise that the UK's forthcoming exit from the European Union is no small undertaking, but importantly it does present the opportunity to strike free trade deals around the world and build on our already very strong relationship that we have with Japan,"" Mrs May told the assembled bosses.
""As we look to the relationship between the UK and Japan we see already year-on-year trade between our two countries continues to increase, with Japans's investment in the UK reaching Â£46.5 billion in 2016.""
Alongside the car companies Honda, Nissan, Mitsubishi and Toyota, representatives from Japanese banks and drug companies were also due to attend the meeting.
Japanese firms have spent billions of pounds in Britain over the past decades, encouraged to set up in the country by successive governments promising a business-friendly base from which to trade across the continent.
Nissan, Toyota and Honda began their UK operations in Britain in the 1980s and now build nearly half of all of Britain's 1.67 million cars. The big majority of these are exported.
The motor industry has expressed concern that their exports could face tariffs of up to 10% and be subject to customs delays after Britain leaves the European Union.
Japanese drug companies have also made Britain their European base. Some are concerned about future drug regulations, with any divergence with the EU likely to pose regulatory challenges.
London is also home to Japanese banks, such as Nomura, Daiwa Securities and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial. Like other foreign banks, they are keen to know about trading and so-called ""passporting"" arrangements for access to the EU.

"Parliament repairs - how much will they cost?
Parliamentary correspondent
This week, MPs voted to move out of their iconic Victorian home, the Palace of Westminster, for five years or more, to allow for vital ""
Next week, the House of Lords will debate the same subject.
If peers sign up, it will be the first time Parliament has moved out of its ancient seat since the Luftwaffe bombed the Commons Chamber in 1941.
Everyone accepts Parliament's main building is in a terrible state. The roof leaks, the wires crackle, the century-old pipes drip, the structure is riddled with asbestos and the sewage system leaks. A high-powered parliamentary committee warned in 2016 that there was a considerable risk of catastrophic breakdown, which could force the parliamentarians to move out.
At the moment we're dealing with a figure between £3.5bn and £5.6bn, depending on how the project is approached. The Parliamentary authorities call these ""indicative costings"", because, like the owners of any ageing property, they are in the position of not knowing what the real scale of the restoration task is, until the floorboards come up and the brickwork is exposed.
Yes, the estimates run up to £5.6bn. It's an enormous sum of money… but this is a vast building, and one of the most recognisable on the planet. And with all the elaborate stonework, endless wood panelling and opulent Victorian gothic décor, restoration will not be cheap.
Remember, too, this is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which means it cannot be allowed to simply fall down.
Restoration has to take place regardless of whether MPs and peers stay or go. But one reason a decision has taken so long to emerge is the political nervousness about spending on this scale at a time of austerity and squeezed public services.
Much depends on whether the work is done around the sitting tenants, the MPs, peers and staff, or whether they are moved out, or whether they leave part of the building but remain in another part.
MPs have just agreed the so-called ""total decant option"" - moving everyone out for as long as it takes (five to eight years) which is the cheapest option, estimated at £3.52bn.
A two-phase scheme, doing one half of the Palace at a time would (if feasible) cost an estimated £4.42bn over nine to 14 years - and the most expensive would be a rolling programme across 25 to 40 years, costing £5.67bn.
Despite the Commons vote, these options are not entirely off the table, because some MPs might try to revive them, once more detailed costings are available.
And we all know what happens with estimates - the cost or repairs to the Elizabeth Tower, which houses Big Ben, have over-run by £25m.
This picture, from Parliament, shows old pipes, some of which are more than 100 years old and past their life expectancy.
But again this is an example of the way the full extent of the work needed only becomes clear when the builders and engineers can see what's under the surface. And no-one really knows how much it might cost to provide proper 21st century disabled access, for example.
It is going to be a long time before the builders move in.
First, a much more detailed scoping exercise is needed, to establish exactly what needs to be done.
Secondly, there needs to be somewhere for the parliamentarians to move to, if they have to leave the Palace of Westminster - so they won't be moved out before a revamp of some existing office space, and the construction of a temporary chamber. The best guess is that this won't happen until 2025 - and that date could slip.
Could Parliament be forced out before that?
Yes. The fire alarms go off about 60 times a month - and there have been incidents of sewage pipes bursting and of electrical failures.
In the bowels of the building, electrical cables are intertwined with steam pipes from the heating system. One of the major risks is that the steam pipes will crack and short out the building's electrical system. It would then become unusable.
We might well see MPs and peers being led out of the Palace by torchlight.
The current plan is that they will relocate to offices and a temporary chamber in Richmond House, the old Department of Health building directly to the north of the Parliamentary Estate, on Whitehall. This will entail an almost complete rebuild of Richmond House - and the result would be an emergency chamber that MPs could move into if some disaster struck in the future.
Is this a chance to improve the building?
Yes. Clearing out the tangles of redundant wiring, pipes and machinery in the basement levels of the Palace will liberate a great deal of extra space for new uses. This could provide better access for the vast number of visitors to the Palace. Many MPs want a better secondary chamber than the current Westminster Hall, and at the very least a better data network.
Why can't Parliament move somewhere else?
It could, if MPs and peers wanted to. But the experience of the Scottish Parliament demonstrates that new-build parliaments don't come cheap.
A deeper objection is that Parliament is right next to the government - the offices of the main departments are moments away, which means a minister can be summoned to the Chamber at very short notice; accountability would be weakened if ministers took a significant amount of time to get to wherever Parliament moved to. And that's leaving aside the objection to moving away from Westminster, where Parliament has had its permanent home for the best part of 500 years.
If Parliament moves out, might it never get back in? This is one of the central fears for many MPs - but there is talk of writing a guarantee of their return into law.
A Delivery Authority, modelled on the one which successfully ring-mastered the 2012 Olympics, will now be set up, which will require a bill to go through Parliament. This is the body which will prepare more detailed plans and cost estimates. Hold on to your hats.
Mark D'Arcy presents Radio 4's Today in Parliament at 11.30pm on Friday, where he'll be continuing the debate.

"UK sets out post-Brexit transition period position
The UK is sticking to its demand for a transition period of about two years after Brexit - or longer if necessary, according to a leaked document.
The EU has said it wants the transition to end no later than 31 December 2020, 21 months after Brexit in March 2019.
But the UK has set out what it wants in a response to an EU list of demands published last month.
In the document, due to be published later on Wednesday, the UK says it wants at least 24 months.
""The UK believes the period's duration should be determined simply by how long it will take to prepare and implement the new processes and new systems that will underpin the future partnership,"" the document says.
""The UK agrees this points to a period of around two years, but wishes to discuss with the EU the assessment that supports its proposed end date.""
The UK also wants a mechanism to object to new European legislation introduced during the implementation phase.
The prime minister had suggested that EU nationals who arrive during the transition period should not have the right to settle permanently in the UK.
But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the leak suggested the UK ""has softened its position"".
She added that the UK side thinks the positions are close:
It comes after more than 60 Brexit-supporting Tory MPs have written to Theresa May to insist the UK make a clean break with the EU.
The MPs say the UK must not be stopped from negotiating trade deals with other countries, once it leaves the EU, and must gain full ""regulatory autonomy"".
The letter was sent by the European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg.
Opposition critics accused the PM of being ""too weak"" to confront the ""hard Brexiteers"" in her own party.

"Jeremy Hunt to pledge £20,000 'golden hello' for rural GPs
Newly-qualified GPs are to be offered a one-off payment of £20,000 if they start their careers in areas that struggle to attract family doctors
The £4m scheme, to be announced by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, aims to boost the numbers of doctors in rural and coastal areas of England.
Mr Hunt will also pledge to ""secure general practice for the future"".
The Royal College of GPs backed the plan, which says there is a ""serious shortage"" of family doctors.
The one-off payment will be offered to 200 GPs from 2018.
As of September 2016, there were
Mr Hunt is due to speak at the Royal College of GPs' annual conference in Liverpool, where he will offer something for those already in the profession too, by announcing plans for flexible working for older doctors - to encourage them to put off retirement.
He will also confirm plans for an overseas recruitment office which will aim to attract GPs from countries outside Europe to work in England.
""By introducing targeted support for vulnerable areas and tackling head-on critical issues such as higher indemnity fees and the recruitment and retention of more doctors, we can strengthen and secure general practice for the future,"" the health secretary will say.
The Royal College of GPs said the package must be delivered in full and welcomed the commitment to incentivise working in remote and rural areas.
a year for general practice in England - part of which will fund plans for 5,000 extra GPs by 2020.
But Dr Richard Vautrey, chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said the government was not on course to reach that target.
""General practice is facing unprecedented pressure from rising workload, stagnating budgets and a workforce crisis,"" he said.
""'Golden hellos' are not a new idea and unlikely to solve the overall workforce crisis given we are failing badly to train enough GPs to meet current demands.""
In 2016, the BBC learned that there were some practices in England
But The Nuffield Trust think tank said recruitment was ""only half the battle"".
""The NHS is struggling to hang on to qualified GPs, with surveys showing 56% plan to retire or leave practice early. Many trainees also drop out when they finish,"" said senior policy fellow Rebecca Rosen.

"BA to get strike cover from Qatar Airways
British Airways mixed-fleet cabin crew will strike for 16 days from 1 July
The government says it will allow the lease by British Airways of some Qatar Airways planes and crew to help cover a 16-day strike by some UK staff.
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling says BA can lease nine Qatar A320 and 321 planes and crew after advice from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
BA will use the staffed planes to minimise flight cancellations and passenger disruption from Saturday.
The 16-day strike was prompted by what Unite union calls BA's ""poverty pay"".
The long-running industrial action concerns around 2,000 of the airline's mixed-fleet staff who, if they joined since 2010, fly short and long-haul routes mainly from Heathrow airport and earn less than cabin crew on earlier agreements.
The airline has already cancelled a small number of flights from Heathrow and merged others, but the leasing deal with Qatar means BA will be able to get the vast majority of passengers to their destinations.
A spokeswoman for the carrier said: ""We will operate 99.5% of our schedule. Our Oneworld partner, Qatar Airways, will be operating a small number of short-haul flights on our behalf.""
""We have merged a very small number of Heathrow long-haul services and all customers affected have been notified over the past week.""
The airline needed to apply for approval from Mr Grayling and the CAA had to make a recommendation to the minister because the Qatari aircraft and crew are coming in from outside the European Union.
A spokesperson for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said: ""An application by British Airways to temporarily 'wet lease' [hiring plane and crew] nine Qatar-registered aircraft has today been approved by the UK Department for Transport.""
Unite had requested the CAA recommend blocking the wet-lease deal, claiming it broke EU regulations and cited concerns over Qatar's human rights and labour standards record.
The union brought about the unprecedented strike action because of a pay dispute and it claimed the airlines had removed concessions and perks for staff if they had taken part in previous strike action.
Unite national officer Oliver Richardson said: ""Vindictive threats from British Airways amount to corporate bullying from an airline more interested in punishing workers on poverty pay than addressing why cabin crew have been striking.""

"Jimmy Kimmel tells of newborn son's illness
Jimmy Kimmel, seen here at the Oscars in February, told how his son turned purple and needed open heart surgery
US television host Jimmy Kimmel has tearfully told of his newborn son's illness and brush with death last week.
At the end of his story he made a plea for people to support the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
: ""No parent should ever have to decide if they can afford to save their child's life.""
President Trump made repealing Obamacare one of the central tenets of his campaign, castigating its costs and calling it a ""disaster"".
, in an embarrassing setback for the new administration, but Republicans still aim to change the system.
Kimmel - a fixture of late-night TV in the US and host of this year's Oscars - told the studio audience on his regular show that three hours after a normal birth, his son Billy started to turn purple.
One nurse spotted it and took him away for checks, soon finding that he had a heart illness. The situation looked serious, and ""we had atheists praying for us,"" he said.
But Billy went through open heart surgery at three days old and, thanks to the efforts of the staff at the children's hospital, he survived.
""You know, before 2014, if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was, there was a good chance you wouldn't be able to get health insurance because you had a pre-existing condition,"" Kimmel said.
""If your parents didn't have medical insurance, you might not live long enough to even get denied.""
He continued: ""If your baby is going to die and doesn't have to it shouldn't matter how much money you make.
""I mean I think that's something that whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or something else - we all agree on that, right?""
""This isn't football. There are no teams; we are the team. No parent should ever have to decide if they can afford to save their child's life. It just shouldn't happen, not here.""
One of the people behind the Affordable Care Act, Andy Slavitt, tweeted that those who watched Mr Kimmel's monologue should use it as inspiration to lobby Congress.
Remind me, what is Obamacare?
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the law's formal name, aims to decelerate the growth of US health spending, which is the highest in the world.
Obamacare is kept solvent by an individual mandate that requires Americans who do not receive medical insurance through their employers, or free healthcare from the government, to buy such coverage through government-run websites called marketplaces.
The programme offers subsidies to make health insurance more affordable and aims to reduce the cost of such policies by bringing younger, healthier people into the medical coverage system.
Obamacare also requires businesses with more than 50 full-time employees to offer health insurance.
Why is it so controversial?
There around 20 million additional Americans who now have health insurance under the law.
But the programme has been rocked by premium hikes - which were a problem before Obamacare - and a trio of national insurers abandoning the online marketplaces.
Its individual mandate is unpopular because many uninsured Americans who end up paying tax penalties are low-to-moderate income workers juggling rent, car payments or student loans.
, too, because it bans insurance companies from denying health coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions and allows young people to remain on their parents' plans until age 26.
Obamacare has also defied Republican predictions that it would bloat government expenditure.

"UK shipyards: Plans for 'renaissance' to be unveiled
John Linton/BAE Systems/PA
HMS Queen Elizabeth was built in blocks across six cities before being assembled in Rosyth in Scotland
A new national ship-building strategy intended to bring about a renaissance for UK shipyards is to be unveiled by Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon.
Under the plans, the government will buy at least five frigates, and share the construction between shipyards around the UK.
The first batch of new Type 31e frigates would be built with the export market in mind, said Sir Michael.
It comes as the Ministry of Defence aims to save billions of pounds.
As the ship-building industry is revived, the MoD hopes it can serve both the Royal Navy and navies of allies and partners.
The new frigates would be build across different shipyards, but assembled at a central site, and ready for service by 2023.
Their cost would be capped at £250m each.
Analysis: Will the plan work?
By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent
The strategy has been called ""ambitious"" and with reason.
Will there be enough work to sustain several shipyards in the UK? Will there really be demand from abroad for British-designed warships?
And can you really build a frigate for just £250m? Defence doesn't have a great record of keeping costs under control.
And that highlights a larger problem. The MoD's budget is once again in crisis. It's equipment programme has become more expensive because of a fall in the pound.
It still has to find tens of billions of pounds in ""efficiency savings"". And all three services are struggling to recruit and retain key personnel.
Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon boasts of a growing defence budget. But the sums still don't add up.
To balance the books, the MoD will need to make another round of painful defence cuts.
Sir Michael said: ""This new approach will lead to more cutting-edge ships for the growing Royal Navy that will be designed to maximise exports and be attractive to navies around the world.
""Backed up by a commitment to spend billions on new ships, our plan will help boost jobs, skills and growth in shipyards and the supply chain across the UK,"" he added.
Scottish National Party defence spokesman Stewart McDonald said the plans had ""nothing to do with ambition"".
""It is all about squeezing costs to the bone and cutting corners, and still leaves real uncertainties for the future for workers at Scottish shipyards and the communities that depend on them.""

"Bitcoin swings as civil war looms
Bitcoin's value has dipped and soared as opinion about whether it will split has shifted
The value of the virtual currency Bitcoin has always been volatile.
Even so, there has been particular turbulence in recent days as fears of a ""civil war"" among its adherents first grew and then subsided, although they have not gone away altogether.
On Sunday, the value of one bitcoin dropped to about $1,863 (£1,430) before bouncing back to $2,402 on Wednesday, according to data
- still some way off a June high of $3,019.
Bitcoin risks becoming a victim of its success.
The popularity of the financial technology has caused a slowdown in the amount of time it takes for transactions to be processed, with some users complaining of
for confirmation of trades when the
Moreover, fees have also risen, hitting a high of $5 per transaction at the start of June.
That makes it too costly to justify its use for some purchases, such as buying a pint of lager in a Bitcoin-accepting pub.
There are ways around the problem, but the cryptocurrency's community has been split over which solution to adopt.
The risk is that Bitcoin could effectively split in two, with one type becoming incompatible with another, ultimately undermining confidence in the project altogether.
In simple terms, why does this problem exist?
The issue is that Bitcoin's underlying technology has an in-built constraint: the ledger of past transactions, known as the blockchain, can have only 1MB of data added to it every 10 minutes.
To understand why, it's helpful to first understand how Bitcoin works.
To authenticate Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" takes place, which involves volunteers' computers racing to solve difficult mathematical problems.
For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. As a reward, the successful miners are given newly generated bitcoins.
An updated copy of the blockchain database is then copied to all the computers involved in the validation process, which are referred to as ""nodes"".
Bitcoin originally did not have the 1MB/10min blockchain limit, but the feature was added to
against denial of service (DoS) attacks, which might overwhelm the blockchain by flooding it with tiny transactions.
Buying bitcoins has become expensive in itself
Mining, by the way, has become a big business in its own right, with some companies investing in huge ""farms"" of computers dedicated to the activity. Several of the biggest are based in China.
So, why not just raise the limit?
Many of the miners have, in fact, favoured the so-called Bitcoin Unlimited solution.
They said that allowing them to increase the 1MB block size would speed up transactions and reduce transactions fees.
But this could also make mining more expensive, and impractical for small ""mom and pop"" operations, leaving it under the control of a handful of large corporations.
That is because more processing power would be needed to verify transactions.
Furthermore, additional data bandwidth and storage space would be needed to transmit and store the blockchain, since it would become much bigger.
Critics also say the move would make Bitcoin more vulnerable to hackers.
Moreover, some people are concerned that giving the miners power to vary the block size might undermine the principle of Bitcoin being decentralised, with no equivalent to a central bank running the show.
Some software developers have favoured reorganising the format of Bitcoin transactions to make the blockchain more efficient.
Specifically, they propose relocating "" transaction signatures"" - which unlock bitcoins so they can be spent - from within the blockchain to a separate file transmitted alongside it.
Doing so should make it possible to process transactions at double the current rate.
And as an added benefit, ""node"" computers could save on storage space by opting not to keep records of the oldest signatures.
This scheme is known as Segregated Witness, or Segwit.
However, critics say it would deliver only a temporary respite while adding an extra level of complexity.
A middle-ground solution - called Segwit2x - aims to start sending signature data separately from the blockchain later this week and then to double the block size limit to 2MB in three months' time.
An initiative called Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 91 (BIP 91) states that if 80% of the mining effort adopts the new blockchain software involved and uses it consistently between 21 July and 31 July, then the wider community should accept this as the solution.
The good news for those who like the idea is that close to 90% of miners appear to back the effort, according to Coin Dance, a
Other plans exist to try again after August if the target is missed.
But a risk remains that if use of Segwit2x software never reaches the required threshold or that hardcore opponents refuse to buckle, then it could result in two different versions of the blockchain, and in effect two types of Bitcoin.
Such as schism could help rival cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, prosper and ultimately doom Bitcoin altogether.
One expert, however, said he believed that was an unlikely outcome.
""The vast majority of people in the Bitcoin community are opposed to splitting Bitcoin it into two competing cryptocurrencies,"" said Dr Garrick Hileman, research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.
""Such a move would weaken Bitcoin's network effect advantage and sow confusion.
""It is much more likely that people who are dissatisfied with Bitcoin's direction will simply move on to something else, which is what we've seen in the past.""

"Mobile phone tracking data 'could replace census questions'
Thousands of people have had their movements tracked by the Office for National Statistics to see if they can find out where they live and work.
The ONS is trying to build up a picture of people's daily commute - something it normally asks about in the census.
Mobile phones create a record of every location visited by the user if the phone is switched on.
Statisticians believe the data, which is anonymised, could one day replace census questions in England and Wales.
But it admitted it would need to carry out ""extensive evaluation"" of ""privacy impacts"" if it went down that route.
was carried out using data from subscribers to the Vodafone mobile phone network. It was restricted to subscribers aged over 18 and did not include people who use pay-as-you-go phones.
It tracked where phones were overnight, to work out where users lived, and where they travelled during the day, which was assumed to be their place of work.
It focused on three London boroughs - Lambeth, Southwark and Croydon - and looked at how far people travelled to work during a four week period in March and April last year.
It painted a slightly different picture to the 2011 census, with more people appearing not to leave their home borough on their daily commute.
The Office for National Statistics tracked phone users around London
Some of this might be down to students, who may have been ""mistakenly inferred as commuters as their movement behaviour will be similar"", the report said.
""It's also likely that some parents will take out subscriptions for their children's mobiles,"" said the report, so in future ""children of secondary school age and in higher education might therefore also be included"".
The mobile data underestimated some commuter flows, such as the number of people travelling into Lambeth every day.
The study may have failed to indentify commuters with ""non-standard work patterns, such as night or shift workers; depot workers and those on zero-hours contracts"" or those that were ill on holiday, the report said.
The ONS is now asking for feedback to decide whether the new system will be rolled out more widely.
The government and local authorities use this kind of census household and working patterns data to plan housing developments and transport networks.
The census has been carried out every 10 years since 1801, with the exception of 1941, to provide a snapshot of the size of the country's population and details about how people live and work.
But the government wants the next census, in 2021, to be the final one to be carried out using the traditional paper-based questionnaire method.
It has asked the Office for National Statistics to explore how it can get the information it needs from alternative sources.

"Comic-Con: Which fans are 'crazier' - Star Wars or Game of Thrones?
Members of any fandom are passionate, but Game of Thrones and Star Wars actress Gwendoline Christie was put in an awkward position when she was asked which of her fan bases was ""crazier"".
During the Game of Thrones panel at Comic-Con, a fan asked Christie - who plays Brienne of Tarth in the fantasy drama and Captain Phasma in the latest Star Wars films - who was more passionate.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, she gave a diplomatic answer.
""It's not really a craziness, but the level of passion is pretty much equal,"" she said.
""What is noticeable is that Star Wars is something many of us grew up with, which gives many of us a sense of hope. That's how I feel - like I came home.
""With Game of Thrones, we're going into season seven now, and there's a similar feeling. I hope that Game of Thrones lives on so people have that same feeling of home and love for it.""
Gwendoline Christie said at the Q&A she would like to appear in a musical
Christie was joined by cast mates Jacob Anderson (Grey Worm), Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Liam Cunningham (Ser Davos), Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy), Nathalie Emmanuel (Missandei), John Bradley (Samwell Tarly), Conleth Hill (Lord Varys) and Isaac Hempstead-Wright (Bran Stark) at the panel.
And fans were delighted it was hosted by Kristian Nairn, who starred as Hodor until season six.
However, since season seven began this week, the cast members were tight-lipped - not giving much away and talking mainly around their characters.
Alfie Allen decided to bring his puppy to Comic-Con, which was well behaved during the hour-long panel.
It's Hodor! And he speaks in full sentences!
Sophie Turner received a brief boo from the crowd when she said she wished she could bring back the evil Joffrey to the show, but only because she enjoyed working with Jack Gleeson who played him.
Liam Cunningham joked that a Game of Thrones spin-off show was in the works called Better Call Davos.
When asked what new laws they'd make in Westeros if they were on the throne, Nathalie Emmanuel said she'd give education for everyone and John Bradley (above centre) wanted Maesters to clean up ""their own stinking"" waste.
Isaac Hempstead-Wright wanted a warm holiday scene for all the characters who usually film in cold places. Which is fair enough - winter has been coming for a while.
of what's to come in episode two this coming week was also shown to the crowd and released by HBO shortly after.

"Smartphones that charge in five minutes 'could arrive next year'
StoreDot has produced mock-ups of a smartphone charging in a special dock
Smartphones with batteries that fully charge in five minutes could be available to consumers next year.
The technology was first shown off in 2015, when Israeli start-up StoreDot demonstrated
Chief executive Doron Myersdorf told the BBC it is now expected to enter production in early 2018.
However, Ben Wood, a technology analyst at CCS Insight, said he had doubts about the claims.
Mr Myersdorf said he could not reveal which manufacturers were signed up to use the technology.
In 2015, he told the BBC his firm's battery contained materials that allowed for ""non-traditional"" reactions and the unusually fast transfer of ions from an anode to a cathode - the electrical process that charges a battery.
The design involves nanomaterials, which feature extremely small structures, and - unnamed - organic compounds.
The BBC was shown a demonstration of the fast-charging battery in 2015
Some versions of the battery were thicker than most smartphone batteries at the time, but now Mr Myersdorf has claimed it is ready for the market.
""We will charge a smartphone in five minutes,"" he said.
He added that the technology was in pilot production at two Asian battery makers and that ""mass production"" was expected to commence in the first quarter of 2018.
Mr Wood, while remaining unconvinced whether the rollout would happen as quickly as claimed, did admit that if the battery worked as planned, then it could be a major moment in the industry.
""Taking risks with battery technology can bite you,"" he told the BBC. ""I would say that experience has taught me to always remain sceptical. Let's see if it happens would be my view.""
He pointed out, for example, that any design that generates large amounts of heat can impact the performance of the battery.
However, he added that anyone who did manage to crack the ""battery problem"" could have a transformational effect on consumer electronics.
Other manufacturers are also working on quick-charging battery tech.
In November, Qualcomm announced
, for example, that offers five hours of battery life following a five-minute charge.
StoreDot claims it could also charge a car battery in only five minutes
StoreDot also unveiled an electric car battery that charges in five minutes at a tech show in Berlin this week.
The firm said the battery provides 300 miles of range.
A demonstration of the technology was given at the Cube Tech Fair - though
ended before the battery had finished charging.
""We don't have contracts but we are working with car companies to develop the battery - this will take another three years or so to be on the road,"" said Mr Myersdorf.
By contrast, Elon Musk's electric vehicle firm Tesla says
takes 75 minutes to fully charge the battery in one of the firm's cars, such as a Model S for example.
A 30-minute charge would allow for 170 miles of range with the same system.
""Consumers want charge times similar to filling up their cars at a petrol station,"" said Joe Kempton, an analyst at Canalys.
But real applications would depend on ""whether the technology can be produced at a large enough scale"" and at the right cost, he added.

"Sophia Bush on why she left 'Chicago P.D.'
Updated 1937 GMT (0337 HKT) December 19, 2017
Sophia Bush as Erin Lindsay, Jesse Lee Soffer as Jay Halstead, David Aaron Baker as Jeremy Pettigrew, Tracy Spiridakos as Hailey Upton, Patrick John Flueger as Adam Ruzek on ""Chicago P.D.""
Playing Erin Lindsay on NBC's drama ""Chicago P.D."" was a dream come true for Sophia Bush -- until it wasn't.
The actress made a recent appearance on Refinery 29's ""UnStyled"" podcast and talked about why she left the show.
Bush called the role her ""dream job.""
""I landed this job that, since I was 20 years old and trying to become an actor, I said I wanted,"" she said. ""And aspects of it, don't get me wrong, were wonderful. But, I realized by the end of the second season I couldn't do that job anymore.""
""I don't have to give everyone the specific breakdown of exactly why I left until I'm ready to do that,"" Bush added.
The star stayed for four seasons. She said she gave her bosses plenty of notice by letting them know between the third and fourth seasons that she would not be returning.
""I understand how the business works and how women are treated. I said, 'I'm giving you not two weeks notice and I'm not coming in here throwing s**t and breaking lamps and saying I'm never coming back,'"" she said. ""I'm giving you 23-episodes notice.""
As for backlash from fans who were unhappy with her departure from the series, Bush said said it helped to have a sense of humor about it.
""It is tough to read thousands and thousands of comments of people; them just being, like, 'You have no respect for us and you didn't tell us,' and it's like, you know what? I had to respect myself in a situation where I didn't feel respected,"" Bush said.

"The most important fossil you've never heard of
Artwork: Tiny could be one of the earliest four-limbed land animals we know of
It's not a household name, but an ancient creature found in the Scottish borders fills a crucial period in the evolutionary record. It sheds light on how four-limbed creatures became established on land.
An ancient animal found in rocks from the Scottish borders is thought to be the earliest known example of an animal with a backbone to live on land.
The fossilised remains of this highly significant creature, called Tiny, shed light on a key period in our evolutionary history.
Tiny has four limbs, a pair of lungs and up to five fingers (the fossil evidence is unclear exactly how many).
""It was one small step for Tiny, one giant leap for vertebrates,"" said palaeontologist Dr Nick Fraser in an interview on the
""Tiny"" was excavated from the Whiteadder river in East Lothian
""Without Tiny, there would be no birds, no dinosaurs, no crocodiles, no mammals no lizards and obviously we wouldn't be around.""
""So that one step is crucial"", Fraser said. ""And this fossil is right here on our doorstep in the Scottish Borders.""
There are infuriatingly few fossils from this important period in our evolutionary history, known as Romer's Gap.
Previously, some palaeontologists had argued that this gap in the fossil record was due to lower than average oxygen levels in the earth's atmosphere.
But the recent discovery of several four-limbed creatures like Tiny, suggests many terrestrial tetrapods were thriving on land about 360 million years ago.
The late Stan Wood, a field collector, spent several decades looking for fossils to fill Romer's gap, convinced that it didn't really exist. In the late 2000s, he began to uncover a number of important fossils near the Whiteadder river in East Lothian.
He phoned Nick Fraser, director of natural sciences at the National Museums in Scotland, to alert him.
then collected rocks from this area and analysed them using CT scans.
Many ancient tetrapods were the size of dogs. So, with a skull just 4cm long, this one was dubbed Tiny.
So why isn't this important fossil better-known? Perhaps because it is so small.
Or perhaps because, to this day, Tiny remains trapped in a rock and hidden from view.
Tiny is so-named because its skull is just 4cm long

"Petya hackers issue fresh ransom demand
Ukrainian cyber-security researchers have been trying to uncover the secrets of the malware's code
The perpetrators of a recent cyber-attack that disrupted businesses across the world appear to have accessed the ransom payments they raised.
Just over £7,900-worth of virtual currency has been moved from the Bitcoin address listed in the blackmail demand that appeared on hacked PCs.
One expert said there was little doubt the funds had been tapped by those responsible for the crime.
And it seems they have now made a fresh ransom demand.
However, analysts suggest the move is intended to confuse investigations into the matter.
In other related developments,
the police managed to prevent a second wave of attacks by shutting down and confiscating computer servers used by a local software company, which is thought to have unwittingly helped the Petya-variant virus to spread.
Ukrainian police issued this image of the confiscated computer servers
And after having repeatedly denied any involvement in the transmission of the malware, the developer Intellect Service has acknowledged an upgrade to its MeDoc tax software was indeed ""contaminated"",
""As of today, every computer which is on the same local network as our product is a threat,"" the company's chief executive Olesya Bilousova told reporters.
She added that one million computers in Ukraine had MeDoc installed on them.
The police have recommended that everyone stops using the program
Hacked computers were forced to reboot, after which they displayed this ransom demand
Although the majority of the detected attacks occurred within Ukraine, according to analysis by security firm Eset the malware also affected businesses across the world.
Their computers became inaccessible after the code spread over their internal networks, scrambling a part of the PCs' operating systems used to locate where files are stored.
High-profile casualties included Nurofen-maker Reckitt Benckiser, Oreo cookie manufacturer Mondelez International, the shipping group Maersk and the advertising agency WPP.
Most of those struck did not, however, pay the ransom demand. This was in part because the email address given by the attackers to contact them was shut down by its German operator.
And until Tuesday, the funds that were raised lay dormant.
The Bitcoin address used in the ransom demand has been emptied of most of its contents
But at 22:32 BST on Tuesday, three transfers were triggered.
Two of these were sent to Bitcoin wallets used to collect donations to the PasteBin and DeepPaste text-sharing services - platforms often used by hackers to announce their activities.
The third and largest of the transfers went to an address that had previously been empty.
A little later, a post appeared on DeepPaste demanding 100 bitcoins ($256,300; £198,500) for a ""private key to decrypt any hard disk"" affected by the attack.
This message appeared on DeepPaste shortly after funds were transferred to the site's Bitcoin account
""Unless the hackers gave away the Bitcoin account linked to the original ransom demand, only they could have moved the funds,"" Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey told the BBC.
""People are gobsmacked they have gone anywhere near it - they can't be daft enough to try and cash it out.
""As far as we can tell, there's no way to actually decrypt affected PCs even if you paid the new demand.
""So, it may be that they are trying to lead a false trail away from themselves.""
Ukraine has accused Russia of being involved in the attack, but the Kremlin has denied any responsibility.
The news site Motherboard said it spoke to someone claiming to be one of the hackers on a dark web chatroom.
that they could decrypt any file scrambled by the Petya-variant. However, they failed to deliver on the promise when given an example to test.

"UK homes to get faster broadband by 2020
The government has said homes and businesses will have a legal right to high-speed broadband by 2020 after rejecting a voluntary offer from BT.
Openreach, owned by BT and responsible for the infrastructure, offered to speed up improvements to 1.1 million rural homes.
The government has promised access to speeds of at least 10 Mbps by 2020.
BT said it respected the government's decision.
The government believes the regulatory Universal Service Obligation offers ""certainty"".
Under the plan, broadband providers will face a legal requirement to provide high-speed broadband to anyone requesting it, subject to a cost threshold.
Matt Hancock, minister of state for digital policy at the department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said on the BBC's Today programme: ""Access means you can phone up somebody, ask for it and then someone has the legal duty to deliver on that promise.
""It is about having the right to demand it, so it will be an on-demand programme.""
In response to the announcement, BT said: ""BT and Openreach want to get on with the job of making decent broadband available to everyone in the UK, so we'll continue to explore the commercial options for bringing faster speeds to those parts of the country which are hardest to reach.""

"Brighton Hippodrome tops 'at risk' list for fifth time in a row
Brighton's Hippodrome started its life as an ice rink more than a century ago
Brighton Hippodrome has been named the most ""at risk"" theatre in the UK for the fifth consecutive year.
The Grade II-listed building in Middle Street is considered the ""finest surviving example of its type"" by the Theatres Trust.
since it closed in 2007, after 40 years as a bingo hall.
Comedian Dara O Briain appealed to local councils to view ""at risk"" venues as ""opportunities"" not ""liabilities"".
The theatre has hosted a range of performers from Dusty Springfield to Harry Houdini
The 2018 list features 35 buildings across England, Scotland and Wales that the trust believes are most in danger of being lost.
The venues face a variety of threats including demolition, loss of funding, lack of maintenance or neighbouring development.
In second place on the list is the historic Theatre Royal in Margate, which dates back to 1787, and is one of the oldest surviving working theatres in Britain.
Morecambe Winter Gardens in Lancashire, the Dudley Hippodrome in the West Midlands and the Victoria Theatre in Salford are also high on the list.
The Theatre Royal in Margate dates back to 1787
O Briain, a Theatres Trust trustee, said at the list's unveiling: ""They are at risk of being lost forever, but they are also so achingly close to being saved.""
He called on local authorities to ""stop viewing these sites as liabilities and start thinking of them as opportunities"".
In November 2017, Brighton's Hippodrome was sold by Academy Music Group to a private investor but the new owner's plans for the building are not yet known.
The theatre has hosted performers such as Dusty Springfield, Gerry and the Pacemakers and even Harry Houdini.

David Fisher, director of Brighton Hippodrome Community Interest Group, said it was ""disappointing"" to top the list again.
He added: ""It's very sad that Brighton should be in this position of not having a theatre of that size. It's really very frustrating.""
Jon Morgan, director of Theatres Trust, added: ""These venues are opportunities for local authorities to support and stimulate their local economy, provide a focus for local pride and act as an important community resource.""

"Billionaire Warren Buffett lines up successors
Forbes estimates Warren Buffett's fortune at nearly $88bn
Berkshire Hathaway has promoted two long-serving executives as it contemplates a future without billionaire boss Warren Buffett.
The two new vice presidents - Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain - are the potential successors to 87-year-old Mr Buffett who has led the investment firm's expansion.
Mr Buffett said he remains in good health.
He described Mr Abel and Mr Jain as having ""Berkshire in their blood"".
The promotions are designed to give the two men experience running more of the business.
Mr Abel, 55, currently chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, has been named as vice chairman for non-insurance business operations.
Mr Jain, 66, Berkshire's top insurance executive, will be vice chairman for insurance operations.
Both were also added to Berkshire's board, expanding it to 14 people.
that the changes should be almost imperceptible from the outside.
""It's part of a movement towards succession over time, and they are the two key figures at Berkshire,"" he said. ""This would have made sense five years ago, too.""
He later blamed ""lethargy, bordering on sloth"" for not making the announcements sooner.
Warren Buffett has a legendary reputation in China, where his image has graced Cherry Coke bottles
Mr Buffett has led Berkshire Hathaway for more than four decades, turning it into a complex conglomerate with holdings in freight rail, major insurance companies, real estate, newspapers and utilities.
Its investments include Geico, the Kraft Heinz Co, Fruit of the Loom and Acme Brick Company, as well as Northern Powergrid subsidiaries, which serve about 3.9 million customers in the UK.
The firm and its subsidiaries employ more than 367,000 people globally.
The companies are run in a decentralised fashion, but major investment decisions remain controlled by Mr Buffett and vice chairman Charlie Munger, 93.
Mr Buffett said he still goes to the office on Saturdays, but succession planning has long been part of the discussions among Berkshire Hathaway board members.
Mr Buffett said Mr Jain and Mr Abel oversee divisions that are different, but roughly comparable in power and importance
He said they won't be pitted against each other to step into his shoes.
""They know each other well, they like each other well, they both have their areas of specialty,"" he said.
Mr Buffett's time at Berkshire has vaulted him to the ranks of the world's richest men, with a fortune Forbes estimates at nearly $88bn.
Sometimes called the 'Oracle of Omaha', Mr Buffett is known for his focus on long-term investments and folksy bearing.
He has lived in the same Omaha, Nebraska home for decades and pledged to give his wealth to charity.
Mr Buffett said another 10 years at the firm would be ""a long time"" but he has no plans to step down yet.
""I love what I do at Berkshire,"" he said. ""It's more fun than I think I could imagine.""

"Midlands sees fastest house price rises
The Midlands saw the fastest growth in house prices over the year to the end of November, official figures show.
Property values grew by 7.2% in the West Midlands and 6.4% in the East Midlands, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
London saw the slowest growth (2.3%) among the English regions.
Separate figures suggested that demand for mortgages had been relatively unaffected by November's rise in interest rates.
The official bank rate was raised from 0.25% to 0.5%, the first increase since July 2007.
The ONS data showed that the typical home cost £226,000. House prices in the UK increased by 5.1% during the year to the end of November, although this fails to show the wide regional and national variations.
Prices increased by 5.3% in England, compared with a 4.5% rise in Wales, a 3.6% increase in Scotland, and a 6% rise in Northern Ireland over the same period.
Mortgage data published by UK Finance, which represents the major banks, show that 34,800 mortgages were advanced to first-time buyers in November, a rise of 15% on the same month a year earlier.
The average first-time buyer was aged 30 and had an income of £40,000, it said.
There were 36,200 mortgages advanced to existing homeowners in November, a rise of nearly 17% on the same month a year earlier.

Pop star Ed Sheeran has broken his arm, putting his upcoming tour dates in jeopardy.
""I've had a bit of a bicycle accident,"" wrote the star on his
, posting a picture of his arm in a cast.
""I'm currently waiting on some medical advice, which may affect some of my upcoming shows. Please stay tuned for further news.""
The 26-year-old was on a break from his world tour, but was due to resume with a gig in Taipei next week.
He has a further 14 dates scheduled this year, including concerts in Japan, South Korea and Thailand, before kicking off the Australian leg of his tour in March.
Sheeran famously plays his concerts solo - using just a guitar and a loop pedal to layer up songs like Thinking Out Loud, Sing and Shape of You.
Speaking to BBC News earlier this year, he said he would never consider playing with a backing band.
""I don't feel like there's anything interesting or new about seeing a singer-songwriter with a band behind them,"" he said.
""I don't feel like if I suddenly got a band, everyone would go, 'Wow!'. I actually feel it'd take away from me.""

"Trump says Apple will build three 'big' new plants in US
Apple's boss attended a technology roundtable at the White House in June
Apple's boss has promised to build three new manufacturing plants in the United States, according to an interview President Donald Trump has given to the Wall Street Journal.
President Trump told the Journal he had a phone conversation with Apple's chief executive Tim Cook.
""I spoke to (Cook), he's promised me three big plants - big, big, big,"" said President Trump.
Apple has declined to comment on the report.
President Trump told the Wall Street Journal during the interview that discussed a range of matters including tax reform, that Mr Cook had called him to confirm plans for the plants were ""going forward"".
During the campaign last year, President Trump made repeated calls for American companies to produce more in the US in order to create jobs and revive the manufacturing sector. Apple was one of the companies that came under fire.
""We're gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries,"" Mr Trump said in a speech in January last year.
Apple currently manufactures almost all of its products in China but the company employs developers and designers in the US and buys some of its parts from US-based manufacturers such as Corning.
A few products are also made by contract manufacturers in the US.
In May the Apple chief executive said the company was creating a $1bn fund to invest in advanced manufacturing in the US.
Foxconn, a major contractor for Apple, has said it also plans to invest more than $10bn in a display-making factory in the US, possibly in Wisconsin.

"Chloe Moretz 'appalled and angry' over body-shaming Snow White animated film advert
US actress Chloe Moretz says she's ""appalled and angry"" over the marketing for her new animated Snow White film, Red Shoes & the 7 Dwarfs.
In a series of tweets, the 20-year-old talks about a poster she'd seen in Cannes which shows a tall woman next to a shorter, heavier version of herself.
The words underneath read: ""What if Snow White was no longer beautiful and the 7 dwarfs not so short?""
Chloe Moretz said she hadn't seen the marketing and has apologised to fans.
Plus-size model Tess Holliday tweeted a photo of the billboard poster and tagged the actress in her post, saying it was basically body-shaming.
The new animated film is a parody about Snow White, and is about seven princes who've been turned into dwarfs and are looking for the enchanted red shoes of a lady to break the curse.
Chloe Moretz voices Snow White while Cocktail and Showgirls actress Gina Gershon plays Regina, the evil queen.
But Chloe isn't happy about the way the new South Korean movie was advertised.
Red Shoes and the 7 Dwarfs producer Sujin Hwang has now apologised for the adverts and the film's first trailer, which have been withdrawn.
, he said: ""Locus Corporation wishes to apologise regarding the first elements of our marketing campaign (in the form of a Cannes billboard and a trailer) which we realise has had the opposite effect from that which was intended.
""That advertising campaign is being terminated.
Warning: Third party content might contain ads
""Our film, a family comedy, carries a message designed to challenge social prejudices related to standards of physical beauty in society by emphasising the importance of inner beauty.
""We appreciate and are grateful for the constructive criticism of those who brought this to our attention.
""We sincerely regret any embarrassment or dissatisfaction this mistaken advertising has caused to any of the individual artists or companies involved with the production or future distribution of our film, none of whom had any involvement with creating or approving the now discontinued advertising campaign.""

"Election 2017: Pound and shares set for volatile trading
Traders are expecting a volatile day for the pound and UK shares after the election resulted in a hung parliament.
Overnight the pound fell sharply, at one stage
, before recovering slightly.
Traders had been expecting a clear victory for Theresa May's Conservatives, but are now concerned about political uncertainty.
The London stock market begins trading at 08:00 GMT.
A weaker pound has supported the UK stock market over the last few months, particularly shares in companies which have a lot of business overseas.
But analysts are concerned about the heightened political uncertainty.
""The unexpected outcome increases the threat of further volatility for sterling and UK assets,"" said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management.
""The result is likely to call the position of the Prime Minister into question, the government is likely to be relatively weak, and the result further complicates the upcoming Brexit negotiations,"" he said.
The BBC is projecting that the Conservatives will be the largest party with 318 seats - eight short of a majority.
While the pound's move is significant, it is far from dramatic.
Some analysts say that might reflect the diminishing prospect of a ""hard"" Brexit.
Although a hung parliament would mean uncertainty, Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said that a ""softer version of Brexit"" was now more likely.
""Mrs May's mandate to push through her clean, hard Brexit has evaporated. Voters didn't want to hand her the blank cheque for Brexit. It may leave negotiations in limbo but would also tend to suggest that the downside for sterling is limited,"" he said.
Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable said ""the whole Brexit approach will have to be rethought"".
Sir Vince is returning to the Commons after regaining the seat of Twickenham in southwest London for the Liberal Democrats.
Election analysis from Kamal Ahmed, BBC Economics Editor
A hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel is less clear.
Deals with different parties may need to be done - each with very different outcomes.
Nervousness in the markets is likely to increase and investors in charge of large amounts of global capital could decide to move their money to more attractive markets, such as the Eurozone where growth has picked up and political risk (the major Dutch and French elections are behind us for example) has reduced.
Sterling fell after an exit poll for the BBC, ITV and Sky released as the polls closed at 22:00 cast doubt on an overall Conservative majority, raising concerns about increased uncertainty and a possible delay to Brexit negotiations.
Sterling has been trading in a range between $1.28 and $1.30 in recent weeks.
the pound is down 1% at 1.142 euros.

"Rail passenger satisfaction 'little changed in a decade'
Train operators handle passenger complaints and delays almost as badly as they did a decade ago, according to research from consumer group Which?.
It also found punctuality levels on Britain's railways were at their worst level in 10 years.
The group said passengers were being ""failed"" and urged the government to push through plans to introduce a rail ombudsman to better handle disputes.
But industry body the Rail Delivery Group said complaints were falling.
Following an analysis of National Rail survey data, Which? found that passengers' satisfaction with how delays are handled stands at 35%, while just 46% are happy with the way complaints are managed.
This is compared with 32% and 42% respectively a decade ago.
Punctuality satisfaction has fallen by five percentage points over the same period to 72% - a 10-year low.
, Which? found the three worst train lines for delays were Southern Rail, Thameslink and Great Northern, and South Eastern.
On Thursday, the owners of Southern, Govia Thameslink Railway,
for poor performance following a wave of delays and strikes this year and last.
Alex Hayman, from Which?, said: ""Our analysis highlights that the rail industry has been failing its passengers, particularly in the way they handle delays and manage complaints.
""This just isn't good enough for the millions of people who are reliant on rail services on a daily basis.""
He added: ""The government's election manifesto made strong promises to help rail passengers, who deserve much better when rail services fail to deliver.
""That is why we need to see the powers and duties of the regulator strengthened, with the government swiftly pressing forward on its plans to introduce a rail ombudsman.""
But a spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said companies were investing to improve services, providing more rolling stock and simplifying fares.
""We're making journeys better and we're sorry when customers don't get the service they expect,"" he said.
""Four in five people say they are satisfied with their train journey and the long-term trend is one of falling customer complaints,"" he added.

"What's the best-selling classical album?
Russell Watson and James Horner take the top three album slots
The Titanic soundtrack has moved people for decades - and now the score has come top of a list of the best-selling classical albums of the past 25 years.
James Horner, who died in 2015, composed the soundtrack, which has sold more than a million copies in the UK.
It was named top of the Ultimate Classic FM Chart, the biggest countdown of classical music sales.
British singer Russell Watson claimed the second and third slots on the list with albums The Voice and Encore.
He's also the most popular male artist, with almost 2.5 million album sales.
Overall, Welsh Mezzo-Soprano Katherine Jenkins is the number one classical music artist of the past 25 years - selling more than 2.7 million albums on the Classic FM chart.
Her albums Living a Dream and Second Nature both feature in the top 10, at six and seven respectively.
Jenkins has two albums in the top 10
She said: ""I was 12 when Classic FM was launched and I feel like we have grown up together.
""I listened as a child, so it was a huge moment for me when they first played my song on the radio - and when they announced my first number one, I remember bursting into tears.""
Jenkins said being the number one artist is ""something I will treasure always"", adding: ""I hope you can hear the cheering all the way from Neath!""
She is not the only Welsh success on the list.
Seven out of the top 20 albums are by Welsh artists and six out of the top 20 best-selling artists are from the country.
Joining Jenkins on that list are Charlotte Church, the Fron Male Voice Choir, Bryn Terfel, Aled Jones and Sir Karl Jenkins.
The chart was compiled by the Official Charts Company, based on UK music sales data.
It covers the top 300 albums released since 7 September 1992 - the day Classic FM launched.
Sarah Horner, widow of the Titanic composer who died in a 2015 plane crash, told the radio station: ""Touching the inner world of the audience was what most composers wish to do, and when he was successful at doing that, I think James felt like he had fulfilled his destiny.""
The soundtrack won Oscars for best original dramatic score for Horner and also best original song, along with lyricist Will Jennings, for Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On.
Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in Titanic
Andre Rieu was named the biggest international classical artist, with nearly 2.3 million album sales - and 11 albums in the chart in total, the most of any artist.
He said: ""Ever since Forever Vienna became my first UK number one album eight years ago, the support from the British public has been incredible. I could not ask for more enthusiastic and loyal fans.""

"Ancestry.com denies exploiting users' DNA
You and Yours, BBC Radio 4
A leading genealogy service, Ancestry.com, has denied exploiting users' DNA following criticism of its
The US company's DNA testing service has included a right to grant Ancestry a ""perpetual"" license to use customers' genetic material.
A New York data protection lawyer spotted the clause and
warning about privacy implications.
Ancestry told BBC Radio 4's
its terms were being changed.
Headquartered in Utah, Ancestry is among the world's largest for-profit genealogy firms, with a DNA testing service available in more than 30 countries.
The company, which uses customers' saliva samples to predict their genetic ethnicity and find new family connections, claims to have more than 4 million DNA profiles in its database.
Ancestry also stores the profiles forever, unless users ask for them to be destroyed.
AncestryDNA told the BBC it would be removing the 'perpetuity clause' from its terms and conditions - still present at the time of writing
The company's UK terms and conditions have stated that users grant the company a ""perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable, transferable license"" to their DNA data, for purposes including ""personalised products and services"".
In a statement to You and Yours, an Ancestry spokesperson said the company ""never takes ownership of a customer's data"" and would ""remove the perpetuity clause"".
It added: ""We will honour our commitment to delete user data or destroy their DNA sample if they request it. The user is in control.""
Joel Winston, a consumer rights lawyer and former New Jersey State deputy attorney-general, was one of the first to spot the legal wording and to warn of the possible implications.
""Ancestry.com takes ownership of your DNA forever; your ownership of your DNA, on the other hand, is limited in years,"" he said.
He added: ""How many people really read those contacts before clicking to agree? How many relatives of Ancestry.com customers are also reading?""
More than 4 million customers worldwide have used AncestryDNA, which requires users to send a saliva sample for testing
Mr Winston also warns that many consumers are unaware of the additional uses of the data.
In its terms and conditions Ancestry makes reference to ""commercial products that may be developed by AncestryDNA using your genetic information"".
One customer, Richard Peace, used AncestryDNA to learn more about his family history.
He told You and Yours he ""knew nothing"" about the commercial use when he signed up for the test.
""I'm not happy about it and today I will be emailing them to ask them not to use the information,"" he said.
Ancestry told the BBC: ""We do not share user data for research unless the user has voluntarily opted-in to that sharing.""
The company added: ""We always de-identify data before it's shared with researchers, meaning the data is stripped of any information that could tie it back to its owner.""
The ambitious scale of Ancestry's plans does have support among some academics.
Debbie Kennett, a genetics researcher at University College London, welcomed the aim of building a large, global DNA database.
""For genealogy purposes we really want, and rely on, the power of these large data sets,"" she told You and Yours. ""A DNA test on its doesn't tell you anything at all.""

"Ariana Grande to get honorary citizenship of Manchester
Ariana Grande is seen by many as ""an honorary Mancunian"", says the leader of Manchester City Council
Ariana Grande is to get honorary citizenship of Manchester under plans put forward by the city council.
The council is proposing a new system to recognise outstanding contributions to the city.
The US singer is in line to be the first recipient for organising the One Love Manchester concert in aid of victims of the bomb attack at her gig, in which 22 people died.
An event to mark ""selfless acts"" after the blast is to be held, too.
Ariana Grande performs during the One Love Manchester benefit concert
Under the proposals for the new scheme, honorary citizenship of Manchester could be granted to those from outside Greater Manchester.
Council leader Sir Richard Leese, said many people would already consider Grande to be ""an honorary Mancunian"".
He said: ""This seems a fitting moment to update the way we recognise those who make noteworthy contributions to the life and success of our city.
""We've all had cause to be incredibly proud of Manchester and the resilient and compassionate way in which the city, and all those associated with it, have responded to the terrible events of 22 May - with love and courage rather than hatred and fear.""
He said Ariana Grande had ""exemplified this response"".
Some 50,000 people went to the One Love Manchester concert at Old Trafford on 4 June, which raised almost Â£3m for victims of the Manchester Arena attack.
Salman Abedi, 22, detonated a home-made bomb in the arena's foyer at the end of Ariana Grande's concert.
Manchester City Council has also announced it would hold an event later this year to recognise the ""great many selfless acts and demonstrations of community spirit in the aftermath of the atrocity"".
The authority said there was a need for a new system of honours in addition to the rarely-awarded freedom of the city, which will remain the highest honour the city can give.
The freedom of the city has only been awarded four times this century.
The plans will go before the council on 12 July.

"Pet Shop Boys share lost Bananarama demo
Entertainment & arts reporter
The Pet Shop Boys are currently taking their elaborate stage show on tour
The Pet Shop Boys are a band of two halves - Neil and Chris; serious suits and silly headgear; a glorious '80s pop past and a constantly reimagined electronic future.
As singer Neil Tennant talks about a new series of reissued albums and an unheard track, those contrasts - which have always kept the band interesting - are as apparent as ever.
He looks back at how they have always looked forward. He has a lingering affection for old-fashioned physical music while admitting to succumbing to Spotify.
He doesn't like Ed Sheeran but says the singer should be allowed to dominate the charts. He wants you to buy one set of reissues but says not to bother with another.
Listen to the Pet Shop Boys' demo version of One Way Street
The ones he's on the phone to talk about are 1999's Nightlife, 2002's Release and 2006's Fundamental, which are being remastered and reissued this month with copious bonus tracks.
One of those is One Way Street, a previously unreleased demo from the Fundamental sessions, which Tennant says he offered to Bananarama at the time - but has now decided he rather likes.
Their first six albums, which were re-released with similar bonus discs in 2001, are also getting another reissue. But if you already own the first remastered versions, you can save your money, the singer suggests.
Does going through the vaults bring back memories?
It brings back a lot of good memories. It was a lot of fun and people often ask Chris [Lowe] and I how the whole thing has lasted so long. We always have the same answer, because it's true: We actually really enjoy going to the studio and writing songs together.
It is work but it's also play, and I think when you listen to the newly reissued stuff you can see that we write in different styles and we experiment and we always write more stuff than we need for an album.
Do these albums strike you as being better or worse than you'd remembered them?
Happily, they seem to me to be better than I remember. When you work on an album and do promotion for it, you can get fed up with the whole thing after a while. And then you don't really listen to it again very much because you've spent so long making it and then talking about it.
Listening back to Fundamental, I felt really pleased because it's quite an epic album and it's the only time we ever made an album which has got a strong concept.
We wanted to make an album that reflected what the world was like in the wake of 9/11, the Iraq war and the increasing surveillance techniques used by governments on their own people. It was a paranoid period and actually I think it expresses it quite well.
Neil (left) and Chris are reissuing all 11 albums they released on Parlophone Records
Tell me about the unreleased song, One Way Street.
In our studio we have a bookcase and One Way Street is the title of a book by the famous philosopher Walter Benjamin which, I hasten to add, I'd never actually read.
Chris was playing something on the keyboards and I saw this book and thought, ""that's a good title"". Actually it's got a catchy chorus. We offered it to Bananarama, who were making a new album. We gave it to them and they rejected it!
The reason we didn't put it out was because I thought the metaphor of a one way street - that something was predestined - was maybe a bit contrived. But listening to it all these years later it's very catchy.
Your first six albums are also being remastered again - how much difference will there be?
Well, it's a controversial thing in some ways because I think records should just get louder. If you bought the collection in 2001, I would suggest you don't buy them again because I think it's a bit ridiculous really. It's exactly the same tracks and the same packaging and the same booklet, it's just that they've been mastered again.
I asked our mastering engineer, 'Do you think you can make them sound better than they did in 2001?' And he said, ""Yes we can, definitely."" And part of me is even slightly sceptical about that. You're not getting any extra tracks or anything. Stick to your old ones, that's my advice.
""Listening to a piece of music requires a certain amount of commitment""
These CDs are physical objects with nice booklets - what do you think of the instant and disposable nature of digital music?
I think having access to everything is amazing. I use Spotify myself sometimes but I also think that what it does is it makes pop music a very casual experience.
Just like reading a book, listening to a piece of music requires a certain amount of commitment from the listener to get the full enjoyment out of it. The ethos of Spotify works against that. When I'm at my house in the north of England, that's the only place I drive a car and I play CDs. Sometimes I've only got one CD.
No, I change them but sometimes I get locked into an old Joni Mitchell album or something like that. I listen to Hejira relentlessly. Or I started listening to Sgt Pepper relentlessly.
What do you think about the
(which saw some of Ed Sheeran's songs leave the chart?)
Someone at some point decided what weight streaming should have on the chart. I don't know about that. But if Ed Sheeran has got 39 out of the 40 tracks or whatever then good for Ed Sheeran. If someone is having a moment of phenomenal success then good for them.
Don't think, ""oh that can't be right so I'm going to change the chart"". I think it's a bit weird. Unless, of course, the whole streaming thing is too weighted. I don't know.
They've limited each artist to only three tracks.
But why? I'm not a fan of Ed Sheeran but I think it's amazing he's done that. I don't think they should change the rules because they don't like it. As though Ed Sheeran's success is some sort of chart virus.
They were mostly album tracks.
Well, the question is, in the world of streaming, what is a single? A single is based on a 45rpm piece of vinyl.
Actually on this last album and probably the album before, every single we've put out has been number one in the CD singles chart. At one point we had three singles in the top 10 of the CD singles sales chart! Not many people put out CD singles, apparently.
Do you listen to current pop?
The album I've listened to this year has been The xx's album, which I listen to in the car up in Durham quite a lot. And I listen to quite a lot of electronic music. I don't listen to that much pop music, actually, but I'll do precisely what I criticised people for doing: I'll flick through things on Spotify.
The duo's UK number ones include West End Girls, It's A Sin and Always On My Mind
Your 63rd birthday was on Monday and you posted a photo of lots of fans in Pet Shop Boys pointy hats.
When we arrived at the stage door at the Teatro Real in Madrid there were all these fans outside who had made pointy hats. They also had T-shirts in the style of the Super album saying, ""Happy birthday Neil.""
It's very touching when people do that. And it's sort of surreal. And when we came out of the gig, there were even more - there was a huge crowd of people and they all sang happy birthday in Spanish.
We've got this tour which we're doing until the middle of October, when we end up in South America, which is where we started. And after that I don't know what we're doing. Isn't that great? But something will probably turn up.

"Paradise Papers documents raise questions over African mining deal
By Paradise Papers reporting team
BBC Panorama, additional reporting by James Melley
Katanga mine in the DR Congo
One of the world's largest firms loaned a businessman previously accused of corruption $45m and asked him to negotiate mining rights in a poor central African nation, the Paradise Papers reveal.
Anglo-Swiss company Glencore made the loan available to Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, a notorious middle man with a close relationship with senior figures in the DR Congo government, in 2009.
Mr Gertler was asked to negotiate a new deal for a mining company in which Glencore had a significant stake, which campaigners say cost DR Congo hundreds of millions of dollars.
He and Glencore deny any wrongdoing.
Glencore agreed to pay Dan Gertler $534m (£407m) to buy him out of their shared mining interests in DR Congo in February this year.
The new details came to light in the Paradise Papers, a leak of more than 13.4 million documents, many from within Appleby, one of the world's leading offshore law firms.
The central African country of DR Congo has been mired in violence and corruption for decades, leaving more than half of its population living below the poverty line.
But the country's vast mineral resources are worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year for those that can access them.
This includes Glencore, a huge Anglo-Swiss mining and commodity trading company.
By some measures it is the 16th largest company on the planet.
For many years Glencore has been involved in mining in DR Congo, in particular the production of copper.
The company says it has invested $50bn there. Ten years ago it had an 8.52% stake in a company called Katanga which had the rights to mine copper in the south of the country.
In June 2008 Katanga's board, which contained a senior Glencore figure, received some bad news.
The DRC government under President Joseph Kabila wanted to renegotiate the terms of its mining licences. Glencore had already invested $150m in Katanga but this could have been wasted if it was unable to mine.
The state-owned mining company Gécamines wanted $585m (£409m) in an ""access premium"" to allow the exploitation of copper and cobalt at the mine.
The previous agreement had been for $135m (£94.5m).
Documents contained within the Paradise Papers show Katanga's board felt the demands of the DRC authorities were ""quite unacceptable"". For the first time, it is possible to see that the directors decided to call for the help of an Israeli businessman called Dan Gertler.
Source document: Katanga board minutes - June 2008
""Dan Gertler, who had a substantial indirect interest in the company, should be given a mandate from the board to negotiate with the DRC authorities,"" Katanga's board minutes from June 2008 show.
""The board... should approach Mr Gertler to see whether he was prepared to act in this way.""
Mr Gertler was asked to negotiate an agreement on Katanga's behalf.
At around the same time, Glencore agreed to lend a company in the British Virgin Islands called Lora Enterprise $45m (£31.5m).
Lora Enterprises was controlled by Mr Gertler's family.
Glencore then loaned Katanga $265m (£185m). This was later converted into shares in the company, allowing Glencore to become its biggest shareholder. The loan to Lora Enterprises allowed Dan Gertler to maintain his stake in the mine. Although Mr Gertler says he did not benefit in any way from the loan.
Katanga announced the larger of the loans to the Toronto Stock Exchange in February 2009, but the details around it were sparse until now.
The terms of the loan to Mr Gertler's company show that if he failed to deliver a new agreement for the rights within three months, Glencore would have been entitled to demand immediate repayment of the loan.
The Paradise Papers documents suggest Mr Gertler was quickly successful. Gécamines reduced the access premiums it was asking for from $585m to $140m, which was close to the original agreement, saving Katanga $445m.
Pete Jones from anti-corruption campaigners Global Witness said deals similar to the one Glencore was able to strike have had serious consequences for DR Congo.
""For a country that dependent on it natural resource wealth, deals like this which just suck money out of the economy have hugely negative consequences for DR Congo.""
Mr Gertler disputes that it was a poor deal for the DRC and says ""Gécamines benefitted significantly from the new JVA including Katanga's release of copper and cobalt reserves to Gécamines worth $825m.""
Glencore told the BBC the $45m loan to Lora Enterprises was made ""on commercial terms and was negotiated at arm's length"".
It also said it was repaid in full by 2010. Lawyers for Mr Gertler said it's not unusual for a lender in a mining deal to demand repayment of a loan if a joint venture fails. They went on to say that ""neither Lora Enterprises nor Mr Gertler nor any company or person related to them received the loan funds directly"".
Mr Gertler's notoriety in DR Congo goes back almost two decades. In 2001 the UN produced a report that accused him of exchanging weapons and military training in part of a deal to secure a monopoly on diamond mining rights.
In 2013, a report by the Africa Progress Panel, led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, suggested Dan Gertler's companies had won mining rights in DR Congo at well below their true value. Lawyers for the Israeli businessman deny the allegations made in the 2001 and 2013 reports.
Last year, hedge fund Och-Ziff agreed to pay $412m to settle a case brought by US authorities accusing it of paying bribes in several African countries. Prosecutors described, but did not name, an Israeli businessman who they claimed paid ""together with others, more than $100m in bribes to obtain special access to, and preferential prices for, opportunities in Congo's mining sector"".
Dan Gertler denies that he did this. Perhaps most significantly, Mr Gertler was also known to be a close friend of a man called Katumba Mwanke, a key advisor to President Kabila before dying in 2012.
Daniel Blint-Kurti from the NGO Global Witness, which has been investigating the relationship between Dan Gertler and Glencore for several years, says the company should have been wary of working with the businessman.
""By hiring someone close to the Congolese president and pumping him with cash and mandating him as their man in negotiations they were running an extremely high risk,"" he said.
Dan Gertler's lawyers told the BBC that ""[He] is a respectable businessman who contributes the vast majority of his wealth and time to the needy.""

"'How I could have stolen my old car using my smartphone'
Technology of Business editor
Charles Henderson found he still had smartphone access to his old car even though he'd sold it
Charles Henderson loved his ""awesome"" convertible, particularly the fact that he could start, lock and unlock it remotely via his mobile phone.
It was one of the first connected cars that synchronise wirelessly with smartphones for entertainment and work purposes.
But after he sold the vehicle, he was astonished to discover that he could still control it using the associated smartphone app.
""I could have found out where the car was, unlocked it remotely, started it and driven off with it,"" he tells the BBC.
Mr Henderson, from Austin, Texas, is global head of X-Force Red, IBM's offensive security group, so he knows a thing or two about security. He tests companies' defences, both physical and digital.
""We try to think like a criminal without actually acting like one,"" he says. ""It's the coolest job in the world.""
So before selling his car back to the dealer he was sure to carry out a factory reset and wipe any personal data from the car's onboard computer. He didn't want the new owner getting access to his calendar, contacts and phone records.
He then bought a new connected car made by the same manufacturer and was amazed when his old car still appeared alongside his new car on the app.
""These IoT [internet of things] devices are really smart but they're not smart enough to know that you've sold them,"" he says.
The modern cliche is that cars are becoming smartphones on wheels
""I informed the car dealership but they didn't know how to handle this. So we went to the car manufacturer and it took a while before they took it seriously. They found it really difficult to cut off access.""
The issue of personal data being left behind in devices we rent or own poses a serious risk - hackers could get access to it and use it for blackmail purposes or to steal our money using cloned identities.
""When they rent a car, many drivers sync their phones to the onboard Bluetooth without thinking that the data will stay in the car's computer. And they won't even think about clearing it before handing it back,"" says Mr Henderson.
More Technology of Business
""Yet they could be revealing sensitive corporate or private data unwittingly.""
Ian Fogg, principal analyst at research firm IHS Markit, says: ""Your smartphone is now the hub for a range of experiences, whether that's in your connected car or your smart home.
""So it's a really critical to protect your data, and when selling it - or the devices it has synced with - to make sure all personal information is thoroughly removed from it.""
Richard Stiennon is chief strategy officer for Blancco Technology Group, a company that specialises in data erasure.
He admits that deleting this data is easier said than done.
""Simply going into a car's settings and deleting your phone from the list of previously paired Bluetooth devices does not guarantee that this will overwrite the data on the car's storage device,"" Mr Stiennon says.
""It will only prevent casual hackers like the next renter from seeing it. A better option is to overwrite all user data or perform a factory reset - if the vehicle allows it - to ensure the data is 100% erased and cannot be recovered.""
If celebrities like Kim Kardashian sync their phones with cars, could hackers target their data ?
Erasing data from a connected car is more difficult to do than on laptops, removable drives and mobiles. When you think about all the different car makes and models, each with their own operating systems and apps, syncing with so many different phone types, which also have their own versions of operating systems, complexity and lack of standards is the order of the day.
Toby Poston, director of communications and external relations for the BVRLA (British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association) says: ""Each individual has the responsibility for making sure that their data is erased, but car makers could make it easier.
""Our members manage millions of hire cars and company cars and we would like to see all manufacturers introduce a 'data cleanse' button to their vehicles as well as enabling this to be done remotely.""
There are also cybersecurity, as well as data protection, issues.
""If the driver's mobile network is infected with malware, it could access private information and copy it back to the car's infotainment system,"" says Mr Stiennon.
""This could lead to sensitive information like financial details, social security numbers and usernames and passwords being accessed and potentially breached.""
It's also possible that an infected car could pass on the infection to your phone.
The data we share with our cars has value, which is why there is such
Mr Stiennon cites the recent case of
and sold the data on to ""ambulance-chasing"" accident claims companies.
As our cars become more connected do you know what data you're sharing with them?
So the next time you hire a connected car it might be worth asking the rental provider what data removal options they provide and whether they can give you written proof that your personal data has been successfully and totally erased.
""When I resell my car, the manufacturer isn't involved in the exchange so isn't focused on the second user experience,"" says IBM's Mr Henderson.
""Although they are beginning to take this issue more seriously, it has to be everyone in the industry - not just the major players. The roads are not brand specific.""
(CAVs) commissioned by the UK's Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders concluded that ""the collection and use of data by CAVs is not a matter of significant concern for consumers.
But how do we know consumers don't seem that bothered simply because they don't yet understand the implications?
""What happens when you get ransomware on your car and you can't drive to work that day?"" warns Mr Henderson.

"Sony chief executive Kazuo Hirai to step down
Sony's chief executive Kazuo Hirai is stepping down and will be replaced by Kenichiro Yoshida
Sony's chief executive Kazuo Hirai is stepping down and handing the reins over to finance chief Kenichiro Yoshida.
Mr Yoshida, Sony's chief financial officer, is to take over control of the Japanese electronics giant from 1 April.
Mr Hirai will remain at Sony as chairman.
Mr Yoshida and Mr Hirai have been instrumental in turning Sony around to focus on smartphone image sensors.
Under their efforts, the Japanese electronic giant sold off its struggling television and PC businesses, and launched the successful PlayStation 4 video game console, which has sold more than 60 million units to date.
Sony said its profits quadrupled in the three months to December.
The Japanese electronics giant reported a record profit of 351 billion yen ($3.2bn, Â£2.5bn) for the quarter, compared with 92.4 billion yen in the same period the year before.
""As the company approaches a crucial juncture, when we will embark on a new mid-range plan, I consider this to be the ideal time to pass the baton of leadership to new management, for the future of Sony and also for myself to embark on a new chapter in my life,"" said Mr Hirai in a statement.
Mr Yoshida said he wanted to build on the management foundation created under Mr Hirai's leadership to ""improve Sony's competitiveness as a global company"".

"Jeremy Corbyn rejects 'progressive alliance' with SNP
Jeremy Corbyn has ruled out any post-election coalition with the Scottish National Party.
The SNP has said it would be prepared to work with other parties to keep the Tories out of power.
But the Labour leader said he did not regard the SNP as progressive.
Prime Minister Theresa May has said the choice in the coming election was ""strong leadership"" from the Tories or a Labour government ""propped up"" by smaller parties.
Speaking in Westminster earlier Nicola Sturgeon held the door open for a ""progressive alliance"" to keep Mrs May out of Number 10 if ""parliamentary arithmetic"" allowed it.
Nicola Sturgeon visited her party's MPs at Westminster ahead of the Commons vote
But she said that - unlike 2015, when she proposed a similar alliance - there was no prospect of Labour winning enough seats to keep the Conservatives out.
""I'm not sure there are many people who think Labour are going to be in a position, on their own or with anybody else, to form a government,"" she said.
""Only the SNP will stand between Scotland and an increasingly hard line and right wing Tory government.""
Emerging from a meeting of Labour's ruling national executive later, Jeremy Corbyn ruled out any deal with the SNP.
He said: ""There will be no coalition deal with the SNP and a Labour government.
""The SNP may talk left at Westminster, but in government in Scotland it acts right. A genuinely progressive party would not refuse to introduce a 50p top rate of income tax on the richest.
""The SNP wants to break up the UK; it has no interest in making it work better. Independence would lead to turbo-charged austerity in Scotland - not progressive politics.""
Labour was reduced to just one MP in Scotland in 2015, but Mr Corbyn insisted his party could rebuild support.
""Only Labour or the Tories can win this election and voting Labour is the only way to remove Theresa May from office,"" he said.
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, who spoke at the national executive meeting, added: ""I told the NEC there is already is a progressive alliance in the UK: it's called the Labour Party.
""The SNP wants to break up the UK - it has no interest in making it work better.""
The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said her party was the ""best bet"" for unionist voters seeking to defeat the SNP in the general election.
While she insisted she has never been a ""particular proponent"" of tactical voting, her party was better-placed than Labour or the Liberal Democrats to take seats from the nationalists, adding there was ""no way the SNP is getting 56 this time"".
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said his party was ""relishing the prospect of this election"".
He added: ""It is a chance to change the direction of the whole of the UK.""
And Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie urged Scottish voters to use the election to ""reassert our choice for a fairer and more equal society"".
on whether there should be an early election, which was passed by 522 to 13.
The party supports fixed term parliaments, but had said it would not stand in the way of an election.
However, Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson - who are both sitting as independents after being suspended from the SNP - voted against an election.
Ms McGarry has been charged with fraud offences relating to a potential financial discrepancy in the accounts of two-pro-independence groups, while Mrs Thomson has been reported to prosecutors after a police investigation into allegations of mortgage fraud.
A decision on whether they will be able to put themselves forward as SNP candidates is expected to be made by the party's National Executive Committee on Saturday.

"Nicola Sturgeon arrives in Downing Street talks with Theresa May
Theresa May greeted Nicola Sturgeon at the front door of 10 Downing Street
Scotland's first minister has arrived in Downing Street for face-to-face talks with the prime minister.
Nicola Sturgeon was greeted at the door of 10 Downing Street by Theresa May, before the two leaders went inside.
Mrs May indicated in September that she
in a bid to break the deadlock between the two governments over Brexit.
They are also expected to discuss the upcoming UK budget, and sexual harassment in politics.
The meeting is the first between Mrs May and Ms Sturgeon since March.
It comes are MPs start to consider
, a key piece of Brexit legislation which is at the heart of a dispute between the Scottish and UK governments.
The Scottish government is refusing to put the bill forward for legislative consent at the Scottish Parliament
to protect devolved competencies as powers return from Brussels post-Brexit.
Ms Sturgeon claims the current proposals are a ""power grab"" by Westminster, and has accused the UK government of keeping the devolved administrations ""substantially in the dark"" on Brexit negotiations.
But Mrs May insists the devolved parliaments will gain ""significant"" responsibilities when the UK leaves the EU.
A series of talks between top ministers from the two governments has so far failed to break the deadlock.
A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said Ms Sturgeon would be ""seeking clarity"" on Brexit and the Withdrawal Bill when she met Mrs May.
Ms Sturgeon has described previous talks with Mrs May as ""very frustrating""
In September, the first minister said in
that she had found previous meetings with Mrs May ""very frustrating"".
Ms Sturgeon said she had found it ""impossible to get any human connection"" with the prime minister, adding: ""This is a woman who sits in meetings where it's just the two of you and reads from a script.""
As well as Brexit, Ms Sturgeon is expected to press her government's economic priorities ahead of UK Chancellor Philip Hammond's autumn budget, which he will unveil on Wednesday of next week.
Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, whose own draft budget will follow in December, has
urging him to ditch austerity cuts, halt the rollout of Universal Credit and provide more money to Scotland's farmers and railways while exempting the national police and fire services from VAT.
And the UK's two most prominent female political leaders are also expected to discuss the issue of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour at Westminster and Holyrood, which has seen ministers forced to resign from each of their governments.
UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon and Scotland's Early Years Minister, Mark McDonald, both left their ministerial posts following complaints about their conduct.
Both Ms Sturgeon and Mrs May have called for better measures to crack down on misconduct and support victims.

"Brexit: Gove 'wouldn't block' PM over EU divorce bill
Michael Gove has said the PM must be given ""flexibility"" to negotiate a Brexit deal and he would not stop her if it meant paying more to the EU.
""I would not block the prime minister in doing what she believed was right,"" he told
The so-called divorce bill has been one of the main sticking points in Brexit negotiations so far.
Theresa May has said the UK will honour commitments made but has not put a final figure on what will be paid.
that some Brexiteers are prepared for the UK to pay more than the 20bn euros (about £18bn) that has previously been suggested.
The money is among issues that must be resolved before the EU will agree to move on to talking about a transitional deal and future trade deal.
Last week, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK had two weeks to clarify what it would pay to settle its accounts, if the talks were to make ""sufficient progress"" before the next big EU leaders' meeting in December.
On Sunday, he told French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche he was making plans for the possible failure of talks, adding: ""It's not my (preferred) option... but it's a possibility. Everyone needs to plan for it, member states and businesses alike. We too are preparing for it technically.""
Leave campaigner and entrepreneur James Dyson, also interviewed on the Marr programme, said it was ""quite outrageous"" for the EU to demand ""billions and billions"" before agreeing to negotiate on a future deal.
""I would walk away. I think that's the only way to deal with them,"" he said.
But Environment Secretary Mr Gove, who headed up the successful Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum, said: ""I can understand James's point of view but on this occasion, respectfully, disagree with him.
""I think it's far better for us to be engaged in these negotiations.""
Asked if he would block the prime minister if securing a deal meant the UK had to offer more money, he said: ""I certainly would not. I would not block the prime minister in doing what she believed was right.""
""We have to make sure that when we are negotiating on money or anything else that we both respect Britain's interests but also make sure, as the prime minister has said, that no EU country is out of pocket as a result of the decisions that we have made.""
""My view is the prime minister and [Brexit Secretary] David Davis should be given the flexibility that they need in order to secure that good deal.""

"Beyoncé surprises Colin Kaepernick with award
Updated 1411 GMT (2211 HKT) December 6, 2017
Beyonce presents Kaepernick with award
Beyonce presents Kaepernick with award
Beyoncé thanks ex-San Francisco 49ers quarterback for his ""personal sacrifice""
She presents the athlete with Muhammad Ali Legacy Award
A surprise presenter proved to be a showstopper at the 2017 Sports Illustrated Sportsperson of the Year Awards, generating as much chatter as Tuesday night's big winners.
Superstar Beyoncé turned up to give the Muhammad Ali Legacy Award to former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.
Introduced by ""Daily Show"" host Trevor Noah, the singer said she felt ""so good to be here on such a special night of appreciation.""
She thanked Kaepernick for his ""selfless heart,"" ""conviction"" and ""personal sacrifice.""
The football player became a lightning rod in 2016 when he began kneeling during the National Anthem before games to protest police brutality and racial inequality.
""Colin took action with no fear of consequence or repercussion only hope to change the world for the better,"" Beyoncé said. ""To change perception, to change the way we treat each other, especially people of color. We're still waiting for the world to catch up.""
Quoting an often-shared message from social media, she added, ""It's been said that racism is so American, that when we protest racism, some assume we are protesting America.""
""So, let's be very clear. Colin has always been very respectful of the individuals who selfless
serve and protect our country and our communities and our families,"" she said. ""His message is solely focused on social injustice for historically disenfranchised people.""
Kaepernick spoke of Ali's legacy as ""being that of a champion of the people.""
He said he began protesting, an act that many feel may have cost him his career in the NFL, because of his love for people. (No NFL team has signed Kaepernick after he became a free agent.)
""With or without the NFL's platform I will continue to work for the people because my platform is the people,"" he said.
Aside from Beyoncé's surprise appearance, SI's Sportsperson of the Year honors went to two Houston athletes -- Texans defensive end J.J. Watt and Astros shortstop José Altuve -- who brought hope to the city after Hurricane Harvey's devastation.

"Breeders' Cup: Gun Runner dominates Classic, Arrogate disappoints
Updated 0232 GMT (1032 HKT) November 5, 2017
Gun Runner never trailed in the race, which has a total purse of $6 million.
Co-favorite Gun Runner, ridden by Florent Geroux, won the Breeders' Cup Classic on Saturday at Del Mar racetrack in Southern California, dominating one of the richest thoroughbred races in the world.
It was never really the plan to lead wire-to-wire, Geroux told broadcaster NBC.
""It was just how the race unfolded,"" the jockey said. ""You need to let Gun Runner be Gun Runner. Whatever is comfortable (for the horse). He is just a beast.""
Collected and West Coast, horses trained by Bob Baffert, finished second and third, respectively.
Defending champion and co-favorite Arrogate was never a factor, breaking poorly from his gate position next to the rail.
""He just doesn't seem to get a hold of this race track,"" jockey Gary Smith said, referring to the horse's prior issues at Del Mar. ""He certainly didn't run his race today.""
Arrogate, who won the Dubai World Cup and the initial Pegasus World Cup this season, struggled to end the year and his career.
But he'll retire at age 4 with an incredible $17 million-plus in career earnings.
Baffert was frustrated by Arrogate's fifth-place finish.
""He's one of the greatest horses I've ever trained,"" said Baffert, who also trained 2015 Triple Crown winner Amerian Pharoah. ""He just took a step back.""
Arrogate ran his final three races at Del Mar and won none of them.
The Breeders Cup Classic is one of the richest in the world, with a $6 million total purse.
Gun Runner, a 4-year-old chestnut colt, finished the 1-1/4 mile race in 2:01.29.
Collected was able to hang just off Gun Runner's right shoulder for much of the race, but when they came off the final turn, the champion took off and won comfortably by 2 1/4 lengths.
Speed apparently is in Gun Runner's blood.
He was sired by Candy Ride, which in August 2003 set the track for a 1-1/4 mile race with a time of 1:59.11.

"Dubai Airshow: Boeing wins $15bn order from Emirates
Business reporter, BBC News, in Dubai
Boeing kicked off the first day of the Dubai Airshow by announcing the first big sales news of the five-day event.
Emirates has ordered 40 Boeing 787 Dreamliners in a deal worth about $15bn (£11.3bn) at list prices.
The Dubai airline's chairman, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, said the aircraft had been chosen over the Airbus A350.
He had been expected to announce a big order for the Airbus A380 superjumbo at the media briefing.
Airbus desperately needs more orders for the A380, the biggest passenger aircraft in the skies.
The Franco-German company and Emirates were understood to be in intense final negotiations to have an announcement ready for this week's show.
Emirates, the largest airline in the Middle East, is already the biggest customer for the Dreamliner's predecessor, Boeing's 777, with 165 in service and another 164 on order.
Sheikh Ahmed said Sunday's order raises the cost of its purchase of Boeing aircraft to $90bn. Some of the new 787s will be used to replace older planes, while others will be used to expand the airline's network.
Emirates flies more than 160 Boeing 777 planes
Boeing welcomed the deal, which Kevin McAllister, head of its commercial aviation division, said would sustain many jobs in the United States.
Deliveries of the aircraft are scheduled to start in 2022.
Also on Sunday, Azerbaijan Airlines said it was buying five Dreamliners, as well as two Boeing freighters, in a deal worth an estimated $2bn.
Amid the display of military hardware and the latest civil aircraft, it is the traditional rivalry of Boeing and Airbus that grabs the airshow headlines.
So far this year, Boeing has won about 65% of the new orders placed for aircraft globally.
Airbus unveiled an updated version of the A380 earlier this year
Neither Emirates nor Airbus would comment on the status of the rumoured A380 order, which would help protect jobs at the aircraft manufacturer's plant in north Wales, where the wings are made.
Emirates has been the biggest customer for the A380, having bought 142 of the almost 320 that are in service or on the production line. The last order for the superjumbo came two years ago, when Japan's ANA purchased just three planes.
In July Airbus said it would again cut annual production of the A380 from 12 to eight. Two years ago Airbus was making 28 planes a year.

"'Black Panther' premiere has fans super excited
Updated 1749 GMT (0149 HKT) January 30, 2018
Michael B. Jordan (left) and writer/director Ryan Coogler at the 'Black Panther' world premiere.
The film premiere was Monday night
""Black Panther"" held its star-studded world premiere Monday night in Los Angeles, and based on social media, it was all fans hoped it would be.
Directed by Ryan Coogler, the Marvel movie starring Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o and Michael B. Jordan is one of this year's most eagerly awaited films and an expected blockbuster.
Boseman plays T'Challa, a prince of the fictitious African nation of Wakanda and a superhero known as Black Panther.
The action in the film takes place after the story in ""Captain America: Civil War.""
In ""Black Panther,"" T'Challa must return to his homeland to take the throne following the death of his father.
Photos from the red carpet (which in this case was purple, the color of royalty) quickly spread on Twitter and Instagram.

"National Lampoon creator gets 'Stupid Gesture' he deserves
Updated 1510 GMT (2310 HKT) January 26, 2018
Will Forte, Domhnall Gleeson in 'A Futile and Stupid Gesture'
A thoughtful yet playful biography about an unsung comedy genius, ""A Futile and Stupid Gesture"" derives its title from a line in ""Animal House,"" one of the signature properties attributable to the late National Lampoon co-founder Doug Kenney. For those who can still remember chanting ""Toga!"" or yelling ""Food fight!,"" it's a nostalgic trip, albeit one with cautionary ""A Star is Born""-esque overtones.
Kenney (Will Forte) is introduced as a Harvard student, cutting up at its satiric magazine with his buddy Henry Beard (Domhnall Gleeson). Essentially desperate not to grow up, the two seize on the idea of securing financing to launch their own humor magazine, which, after some trial and considerable error, blossoms into National Lampoon -- an irreverent breeding ground for much of the comedy world of the 1970s and '80s, including many of ""Saturday Night Live's"" original Not-Ready-for-Primetime Players.
Directed by David Wain (""Wet Hot American Summer""), and adapted from a book by Josh Karp, this ""Stupid Gesture"" cleverly plays around with the conventions of the form. For starters, although its protagonist died under somewhat mysterious circumstances in his 30s, the whole movie is narrated by an elder version of Kenney (Martin Mull), essentially positing what a cranky old coot he'd be had he lived.
Similarly, a crawl races by in the middle of the film listing some of the creative liberties taken, beginning with the fact that Forte is, clearly, too old to be playing Kenney when the movie begins, in his early 20s.
A self-described working-class, Midwestern dork, Kenney's tale has a lot of familiar boy-makes-good-in-showbiz wrinkles to it. Toiling away like a fiend, and philandering when he isn't high on something, he makes a mess of his marriage, along with most of the key relationships in his life that follow.
Kenney chafes at the success of ""SNL,"" which mined Lampoon discoveries like Chevy Chase (played by Joel McHale), John Belushi and Gilda Radner, prompting him to grumble ""This should have been ours"" as he watches the premiere.
After ""Animal House"" becomes a massive hit, Kenney relocated to Los Angeles, yielding the familiar litany of cocaine-dusted parties -- with an abundance of powder flowing around the making of ""Caddyshack"" -- and clashes with studio types.
As the movie makes clear, Kenney was a tortured soul, and the magazine he founded was a product of its time: overwhelmingly white, male and gleefully boorish.
The full title of Karp's book, notably, is ""A Futile and Stupid Gesture: How Doug Kenney and National Lampoon Changed Comedy Forever,"" which might be a trifle hyperbolic. Then again, what would you expect from a movie about a guy who published a cover saying that if you didn't buy the magazine, they'd shoot this dog?
""A Stupid and Futile Gesture"" premieres Jan. 26 on Netflix.

"Logan Paul 'won't be kicked off' YouTube
Logan Paul is a hugely popular YouTube star whose recent videos have proved controversial
Controversial YouTube star Logan Paul has not yet done enough to deserve a ban from the video site, its chief executive has said.
Paul faced criticism in January after posting a video in which he made jokes after seeing a dead body in a Japanese forest associated with many suicides.
It also penalised him after a subsequent video in which he Tasered a dead rat.
Paul has apologised for both videos.
YouTube usually bans a video creator under a ""three strike"" policy - which includes things like copyright infringement or violence.
""He hasn't done anything that would cause those three strikes,"" Susan Wojcicki told a conference audience in California,
""We can't just be pulling people off our platform ... They need to violate a policy. We need to have consistent [rules]. This is like a code of law.""
She added that while some people might think a certain video is ""tasteless"", others might disagree.
""YouTube has been very slow and reluctant to do anything that is meaningful,"" said Alex Brinnand from the magazine TenEighty, which is aimed at YouTube creators.
""Logan Paul is in such a prominent position in the YouTube community that he has... a responsibility and he needs to own up and understand that.""
A separate but also highly popular vlogger, Casey Neistat,
Robert Kyncl this week about how the site manages content created by members of the public.
Mr Neistat asserted that the YouTube model essentially meant that ""drama is rewarded ultimately with dollars"".
In response, Mr Kyncl said the site was thinking ""very deeply"" about disincentivising creators who sought to use drama ""for the sake of views"".
Arya Mosallah: ""The media kind of demonised me.""
Another YouTube star, Arya Mosallah,
after he was accused of uploading a prank video resembling an ""acid attack"".
However, at the time he added, ""you've got to push boundaries to get the views"".
YouTubers are often young people ""egging each other on"", without strict guidance about what is suitable content and what isn't, said Mr Brinnand.
""It's this competition to be the most outrageous and get the most views,"" he told the BBC.
""I can see how you can get swept up in it.""

"'Great American Baking Show' pulled amid Johnny Iuzzini allegations
Updated 1943 GMT (0343 HKT) December 14, 2017
Hollywood hit hard by sexual allegations
Hollywood hit hard by sexual allegations
Multiple women have come forward with allegations
Iuzzini issued a statement Thursday
ABC has pulled ""The Great American Baking Show"" after one of the show's judges was accused of sexual misconduct.
Celebrity pastry chef Johnny Iuzzini is reportedly facing allegations from multiple women who accused him of harassment and abuse.
""In light of allegations that recently came to our attention, ABC has ended its relationship with Johnny Iuzzini and will not be airing the remainder of 'The Great American Baking Show' episodes,"" an ABC spokesman said in a statement. ""ABC takes matters such as those described in the allegations very seriously and has come to the conclusion that they violate our standards of conduct.""
that four former employees who worked for Iuzzini from 2009 and 2011 in the pastry kitchen of the famed Jean-Georges restaurant in New York City described the work environment as ""rampant with incidents of sexual harassment.""
In response to the story, Iuzzini characterized the accusations as ""inaccurate"" and expressed regrets that the women ""did not feel comfortable coming to me as their superior and letting me know how they felt.""
on Tuesday with additional allegations from four more sources. None of the sources were identified by name.
ABC's decision to pull the remaining episodes of ""The Great American Baking Show"" followed.
""While I understand ABC felt pressured to make this difficult decision, I am extremely disappointed and saddened that the show will not continue to air as scheduled,"" Iuzzini said in a statement to CNN on Thursday. ""I feel terrible for the bakers, fans of the show, the cast and everyone else involved in the production.""
Iuzzini apologized in his statement for what he described as ""some unprofessional behavior 8-10 years ago,"" before adding ""the sexual harassment allegations and many other reports against me were sensationalized and simply not true.""
""My friends, family and those close to me can attest that over the last several years I have worked hard on improving myself and made many positive contributions to the industry in which I dedicated my life,"" Iuzzini said. ""Nonetheless, I will use this experience as another opportunity in my life to listen, learn and continue growing as a friend, family member, chef, mentor and as a human being.""
Iuzzini was a judge on ""The Great American Baking Show,"" formerly known as ""The Great Holiday Baking Show,"" which premiered its third season on December 7.
The show was a spin-off of the famed UK series ""The Great British Bake Off,"" and Paul Hollywood from that series served as a judge with Iuzzini on the American version.
The show was hosted by cookbook author (and wife of NBA player Stephen Curry) Ayesha Curry, and former NFL star Anthony ""Spice"" Adams.
Iuzzini is the second culinary star to be embroiled in a sexual misconduct scandal this week.
Celebrity chef Mario Batali stepped away from his restaurant business and his co-hosting gig with the ABC television show ""The Chew"" on Monday, following allegations of sexual misconduct.
Batali offered an apology.
""That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses,"" he said in a statement. ""I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family.""

"General election 2017: Council housing increase promised by Tories
The Conservatives are promising a ""new generation"" of social housing will be built in England if they win the general election.
They say they would make it easier for councils to build more homes, including offering ""fixed term"" council houses to be sold off after 10 to 15 years.
Prime Minister Theresa May said the housing market was ""broken"" and vowed to fix it.
Labour said the plans were ""political spin, with no substance"".
""There's no commitment on the number of new affordable homes or on new funding,"" said the party's housing spokesman, John Healey.
Labour has promised to build a minimum of one million new homes over the next five years, with at least half to be council houses.
The Tories said they expected ""thousands"" of homes to be built each year with ""hundreds of millions"" of pounds invested over the course of the next parliament, without giving precise figures.
Under their proposals, the government would ""strike deals"" with councils and housing associations, offering direct funding to enable them to build more homes and make it easier for them to acquire land for development.
This would include changing the compulsory purchase rules so councils could buy derelict brownfield land at below market value.
In return, some of the homes would have to have a fixed-term social rent - typically 10 or 15 years - at which point they would be sold with the tenant being given the first option to buy.
The Conservatives said this would allow increases in land and property values over that period to be reinvested in social housing.
Mrs May said: ""Giving tenants a new right to buy these homes when they go on the market will help thousands of people get on the first rung of the housing ladder, and fixed terms will make sure money is reinvested so we have a constant supply of new homes for social rent.""
BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says the policy is aimed at voters who might not be traditionally Conservative supporters, including some of the million people on housing waiting lists.
In February, the government set out a string of measures aimed at increasing the number of affordable homes in its
, including giving councils the power to pressurise developments to start building on land they own.
Labour has put housing at the forefront of its election campaign, promising 100,000 new social homes a year with investment from a new national infrastructure fund.
Mr Healey said: ""Under Theresa May and the Tories we've seen seven years of failure on housing, with the level of new affordable housebuilding now at a 24-year low.""
Mrs May could not ""sidestep her share of the blame for the Tory housing crisis"", he added.
In other general election news, Jeremy Corbyn's party said it would impose a tax on financial transactions to raise billions of pounds for public services.
The Lib Dems, meanwhile, are offering a cash incentive to engineering and technology graduates who sign up for the armed forces.
Party leader Tim Farron said the Â£10,000 ""golden handshake"" would help address a ""critical skills shortfall"" in the services.
It would be paid to recruits who committed to serve for five years.

"Amazon: More than 100 cities bid for new headquarters
Amazon says the new HQ will be the ""full equal"" of its Seattle base
US cities seeking to bid for Amazon's second headquarters will need to submit their proposals by the end of Thursday.
Amazon plans to invest $5bn (Â£3.8bn) and create 50,000 new jobs at the new headquarters, which will be a ""full equal"" to its Seattle base.
The investment will also create tens of thousands of other jobs in construction and the surrounding community.
More than 100 cities have expressed an interest in hosting Amazon's new headquarters.
The cities include: Boston; Miami; Austin, Dallas/Fort Worth and El Paso in Texas; Chicago; Cleveland and Cincinnati in Ohio; Oklahoma City; Salt Lake City; Camden and Newark in New Jersey; Pittsburgh; Kansas City; Phoenix and Tucson in Arizona; Nashville and Memphis in Tennessee; and Detroit and Grand Rapids in Michigan.
Amazon announced its search for a location for
The online retail giant said it was looking for:
metropolitan areas with more than one million people
a stable and business-friendly environment
close proximity to an international airport and major roads
urban or suburban locations with the potential to attract and retain strong technical talent
communities that think big and creatively when considering locations and real estate options
Amazon's Seattle headquarters currently houses more than 40,000 employees in 33 buildings.
The online retail giant estimates that it invested $38bn into Seattle's economy between 2010 to 2016, and believes its presence has led to a rise in the number of Fortune 500 companies deciding to move their research and development centres to the city.
While the new Amazon base presents an attractive opportunity for many cities and regions, the company is likely to expect billions of dollars in incentives and tax benefits in exchange.
Most of the cities are keeping their bids a secret, but according to Missouri local newspaper the
, New Jersey is offering almost $7bn in tax breaks in order to sweeten the deal.
In many regions, metropolitan areas are clubbing together to make a single proposal - per Amazon's request - such as in New Jersey, where Camden and Newark are working together.
Camden is considered to be one of the the country's poorest and most dangerous areas, even though it is less than 100 miles away from New York City.
Other cities are putting on publicity stunts to draw attention to their proposals - for example, Tucson in Arizona sent Amazon a huge 21ft-tall cactus plant, while the Mayor of Kansas City purchased 1,000 items from the online retailer and left product reviews extolling the virtues of the city.

They've endured years of pathetic rates with returns on most accounts not even beating inflation.
Yet any small pang of joy experienced will have been extinguished as there hasn't been a widespread increase in savings rates.
What's going on? Are banks and building societies ripping us all off?
The simple answer is no, at least not because they haven't immediately passed on Thursday's 0.5% interest rate rise.
Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, said he expected all providers to increase returns for savers.
""Banks did pass on the cuts to their depositors, and we expect competition to push it in the other direction,"" he said.
And the fact is they will - in their own good time.
It's a certainty that all the major savings institutions will improve the interest rates they pay on deposit accounts by the beginning of December.
They just don't react to a Bank of England base rate change immediately anymore.
""The link between the bank base rate and savings has been severed for years, most recently thanks to government lending initiatives, which has meant banks don't need savers' cash to fund their mortgage books as they used to,"" explains Rachell Springall of Moneyfacts.
In short, the savings rates they offer are driven by competitive pressures rather than tied to the Bank of England rate.
That means you're far more likely to get a decent return from a smaller institution which is keen to build up its business.
And those banks and building societies that have announced plans to increase savings rates from December are simply doing ""a PR exercise"", according to Andrerw Hagger of Moneycomms.
""Other banks and building societies, perhaps with a larger and more diverse range of savings products, will take a more considered view and will need internal approval before making an announcement,"" he says.
But whether they announce quickly to get a PR advantage, or wait a week or so to take a considered view, savers won't be affected as rate changes normally take a month or so to take affect.
In any event, rather than being concerned about such a minimal increase savers would do better to actually check what rate they're being paid. They're likely to be in for a shock.
The average easy access account rate has fallen from 0.45% in December 2016 to just 0.37% today, according to Savings Champion.
""With savings rates with the High Street providers paying as little as 0.01%, it's time for savers to vote with their feet and earn as much interest as they can elsewhere,"" says Anna Bowes of Savings Champion.

"Trevor Noah compares covering Trump era to 'Game of Thrones'
Updated 2159 GMT (0559 HKT) May 29, 2017
Noah: When I see Trump, I see stand-up comedian
Noah: When I see Trump, I see stand-up comedian
The unyielding barrage of news coming out of Washington D.C. has kept late-night programs like ""The Daily Show"" on their toes and, in many cases,
. But do hosts like Trevor Noah ever crave a breath of creative fresh air?
""I think the first mistake people make is that they think of it as a Trump story; I don't,"" Noah told CNN in a recent interview. ""I think of it as the American story, and Donald Trump is one of the characters in the American story.""
As Noah sees it, President Trump is the ""antagonist"" (""we don't know if he's the villain or the hero"") and a ""force in the story."" But he works hard to keep the show's focus on everything affected by the president, as opposed to the man himself.
""It's James Comey's story. It's the Department of Justice story, with Jeff Sessions. It's the story of America's courts -- the Supreme Court. It's the story of an administration,"" he said. ""It's the story of the Republicans, who they are and who they will become. It's the story of the Democrats, the next journey they embark on.""
He put it another way: ""If this was 'Game of Thrones,' Donald Trump would be the White Walkers.""
""Everyone is going to be dealing with it, but it's not the story of the White Walkers,"" he said. ""We want to know what Daenerys is going through, we want to know what's happening with the Lannisters. We want to know what's going on with the Starks. That's the story, and everyone is going to deal with this force that is coming for them.""
Since Trump's election in November, Noah is one of several late-night hosts who've seen their audience grow.
As of mid-May, ""The Daily Show"" is up 36% year-over-year in total viewers and up 18% among adults 18-49, according to Comedy Central.
This comes after one of Trump's harshest late-night critics, Stephen Colbert, saw his ""Late Show"" win the 2016-17 TV season in
, besting ""The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon."" It's the first time CBS has won the timeslot in earnest in 22 years. (It also won in 2009-10, but that was when Conan O'Brien briefly took over for Jay Leno on ""The Tonight Show.)
Noah admitted ""there's always space to talk about other stories."" With just a half-hour timeslot, ""The Daily Show"" team has ""to find the most pertinent information,"" he said. And it's not always what others are covering.
""There might be a story that everyone is focused on, which may be what we feel needs to be focused on as well, but sometimes it's going off the beaten path,"" he said. ""Sometimes it's going, 'No, we're not going to cover that. We're not going to join in that hysteria.'""
Noah added: ""The truth is there are fake stories out there about him, you know? There are often misquotes that people attribute in a negative fashion. He gives you so much real good material, why would you need to do fake stuff?""

"Sia defends using 15-year-old dancer: I'm protective of her
Sia has defended working with a 15-year-old dancer on tour and in her music videos.
The singer said she wants ""empower"" Maddie Ziegler, who regularly joins her on stage.
It's after a Guardian article pointed out that Sia's identity is hidden by a wig while performing - leaving Maddie to be the face of the show.
The reporter who wrote the piece
: ""If fame is so damaging, why pass it on to a child?""
Maddie Ziegler originally became famous after appearing on US show, Dance Moms
The piece suggests the singer has tried to avoid fame in the past but seems willing to expose a 15-year-old to the limelight.
""In 2013, Sia declared she didn't want to be famous,"" it says.
""She described fame as a monster that 'questions everything there is to question. Even things I had never thought to question. Things I had never dreamed of feeling insecure about.
""'Me and fame will never be married.'
""[Sia] herself might not be willing to marry fame but standing on the stage in front of us, she seemed to be officiating another marriage... to a minor who is yet to learn about, or tame, the monster.""
Responding to the feature, Sia said she shares the same concerns as the journalist.
""This article poses a question I have asked myself often,"" she wrote on Twitter.
""I check in with Maddie weekly about whether she wants this, and assure her if she ever wants it to stop, it stops.
""It's a conversation we should all be having. Not just myself, but all directors, stage parents and agents.""
Sia said that the teenage dancer was ""already famous"" before she discovered her but admits she has expanded her exposure.
The singer says she does feel ""responsible for that"" however she has learned that fame affects Maddie differently to her.
""I can only trust that she is telling me the truth. If that changes, we stop.""

"NME: End of an era of excess, drugs and rock 'n' roll
Entertainment & arts reporter
Phil Rees/REX/Shutterstock
NME with Kurt Cobain on the cover after his death in 1994
Imagine, if you can, a time before music stars either transmitted their every inane thought via social media or, depending on their PR strategy, transmitted very few thoughts at all.
Imagine a time when we got some insight into their lives from writers who were blisteringly entertaining and often as opinionated as the stars they were interviewing. When what we did know about our idols wasn't old news within half an hour. When people bought magazines.
OK, there's not much point harking back to the good old days - but the demise of the NME (yes, it's continuing digitally, but it's not the same) is the end of an era.
The New Musical Express is one of those magazines that its readers (anybody over the age of 30 and with decent taste in music) has a deep emotional attachment to.
Why? It bottled the exhilarating, kaleidoscopic, rampant music scene and brought it into our bedrooms.
Music - and those who made it - meant so much. It still does. During its heyday, music was also the most exciting expression of a youth culture that, some of the time at least, was changing British society.
The NME was a doorway to that world.
The Stone Roses' Ian Brown at the NME Awards in 2006
Before rock music was reported in the mainstream press, before music television, and way before the internet, the NME was one of the only places to find out information about bands - or even, sometimes, to see what they looked like.
Picking up a copy from a newsagent on a Thursday, and getting ink-stained fingers as you flicked through its pages, was a ritual.
There were other music papers - like Melody Maker, Record Mirror, Sounds - which have long since fallen by the wayside. But NME was king.
As well as giving you news about musicians, its writers got close enough to the bands to give you a glimpse of their worlds. In the glory days, they would accompany them on tour for weeks on end and witness - and often partake in - the wilder side of rock 'n' roll.
The Beatles appeared at the magazine's Poll Winners' Concert in 1965
Nick Kent, one of its legendary writers, hung out with Bowie, The Rolling Stones and Iggy Pop. Kate Tyler [nee Phillips]
about teaching The Sex Pistols to roll joints, and drinking pernod on a bed with Ozzy Osbourne.
Another NME great, Charles Shaar Murray, told the programme he was the fly on the wall on behalf of his readers.
""I always felt that I was in a privileged position by being on somebody's coach, being in somebody's hotel room, dressing room,"" he said.
""I thought, I have a quarter of a million invisible people on my shoulders here, and I'm going into this space where they can't go and it's my job to convey as much of the experience of what it is like to be here as I possibly can, so they'll feel that they're here too.""
They recounted it all in a pithy, sharp, sometimes barbed style inspired by the ""gonzo"" journalism of the likes of Truman Capote and Hunter S Thompson.
As a result, the NME's writers were idolised almost as much as the stars they wrote about.
Julie Burchill, Danny Baker, Danny Kelly, Tony Parsons, Paul Morley, Steve Lamacq and David Quantick were among the others to make their mark in its pages.
Edd Griffin/REX/Shutterstock
The magazine went free in 2015
as ""quixotic firebrands and towering egomaniacs drunk on their own power and ubiquity"".
Parsons, one of the writers famously recruited through an ad asking for ""hip young gunslingers"", in 1976, wrote in his memoir: ""We were callow and cruel and selling 250,000 copies a week. We were so successful that our owners left us alone to merrily run amok.""
Rock 'n' roll behaviour took place in the NME offices as well as in the stars' dressing rooms.
Karen Walter, the editor's secretary for 34 years,
how, on her first day in the office, she saw blackened spoons in the kitchen - used for cooking up drugs.
She was told that if she wanted to make a cup of tea, she should ""bring a spoon from home and lock it in your drawer"".
When I first started out, my ambitions were to make an album, tour America and be on the cover of the New Musical Express

End of Twitter post by @billybragg
The New Musical Express was like Doctor Who when I was younger, taking me to a magical world I didn't quite understand, very exciting when it landed on earth, with someone older always there to say ""it was better in my day"".

Genuinely upset about NME no longer being printed. Was my bible as a teenager in the 1990s and when I managed to spend a week doing work experience there I was in heaven!

End of Twitter post by @rwhitehouse13
I used to read the NME cover to cover every week, then each Christmas I wrapped my family's presents in the gig listings pages. This clearly had to stop in recent years, as handing over gifts covered in a hair product advert would have been really weird.
End of Twitter post by @tom_airey
The writers lived and breathed the music, though, and had enormous influence.
Mark Ellen wrote: ""If Nick Kent penned a despatch declaring Marquee Moon by Television a masterpiece - which it was - then great swathes of the populace would believe him and buy a copy.""
The paper had the ability to make the careers of those acts it championed. And while it may not have quite broken the careers of those staid stars of soft rock it had no qualms about slagging off, it made them off limits to its army of readers.
The heyday started in the rock 'n' roll boom of the 1960s, went on through the 1970s to the indie and acid house days of the '80s, and fuelled Britpop in the '90s.
It carried on into the 21st Century, but the star power and mystique of many of the artists ebbed away, and there was more restricted access, greater commercial pressure and less of a ""scene"" for readers to identify with.
But, for a while, as former features editor James Brown once put it: ""The NME mattered.""

"Meet the Guides encouraging girls into science and tech
Technology of Business reporter
Girl Guide Catherine Young wants to encourage more women into engineering
The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts is updating its image with a number of new achievement badges aimed at encouraging young women into science and technology.
My memories of the Girl Guides involve marshmallow toasting, tying knots and being assessed on my table-laying skills for a badge no doubt long-consigned to the archives.
Fast forward some 25 years and it's clear much as changed.
In an international organisation that liaises with Google and Microsoft among others, today's young guides are just as likely to be gathered round an engineering bench as a campfire.
Sixteen-year-old Catherine Young is on a mission to boost girls' interest in engineering and has found the Girl Guides a valuable platform for her campaign.
She surveyed girls aged 11-18 and found that 74% didn't have the opportunity to take the subject at school.
As part of the Girl Guide Scotland Action for Change project, she is lobbying MPs to make the subject more readily available across all UK schools.
""Having a national stage for my project has been incredible as this is something I'm very passionate about,"" she says.
""There is a huge lack of female engineers due to the subject not being available, or girls not knowing about it, and we need more females to bring new ideas that could solve Earth's biggest problems.""
Nvidia's Screen Girls project in India is giving girls computer training courses
As the battle to engage girls with Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths - extends beyond the classroom, attention is turning to the role this 106-year-old movement - a female version of the Boy Scouts Association - has to play in cultivating this interest.
The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts has a presence in 146 countries and is busy forging links with tech companies and organisations across the globe.
For example, guides in Tanzania have hooked up with Techchix, a non-profit body that promotes science and engineering to girls at local secondary schools through mentoring programmes.
And in India, girls have teamed up with US-based artificial intelligence giant, Nvidia, to boost female employability in the tech sector.
More Technology of Business
Piloted in the city of Pune, the Screen Girls project aims to deliver computer courses to 400 girls who have recently completed secondary school education. If successful, the project will be extended to other parts of the country.
""Every country will have different approaches and where there is success we will showcase it to the rest of the world,"" says Anita Tiessen, chief executive of the World Association of Girl Guides.
""In the US, for example, there has always been a very strong outdoors culture, so they introduce Stem activities in this way through robot camps and Stem field trips.""
Girl guides can achieve a growing number of science-related badges
A forthcoming overhaul of achievement badges is likely to see Coding and Mechanics added to the list. Google is currently advising on the delivery of a new Web and App Design badge. In the UK, the main Stem-related badges are Science and Communicator.
Girlguiding UK's recent survey with Microsoft found that many members did not see technology as a potential career option, their views influenced by enduring gender stereotypes.
""It is a concern that many girls think of Stem as boys' subjects and don't identify any female role models in this area,"" says Angie Pitt, head of Girlguiding youth programmes.
""We have to think about what we can do to counter this, and the first thing is offering a space where they can learn about these subjects in a way that is fun, accessible and relevant to them - and doesn't feel like school or that they're being judged.""
Projects with Rolls-Royce and BAE systems have led to the development of new ""science investigator"" and ""engineering"" badges - while cloud computing specialist Salesforce recently ran a weekend workshop for 200 guides in London.
When Lady Olave Baden-Powell (centre) was Chief Guide, roles for girls were more traditional
Charlotte Finn, Salesforce's vice president of programs, says: ""Aspects of the school curriculum are rooted in the past and are simply not pairing young people with the skills they need for today's jobs in technology.
""So it's important that organisations like us complement formal education by bringing these skills to the forefront.""
Salesforce also helped develop a volunteer recruitment app for the US Girl Scouts.
Ellie Overland, senior lecturer in computing education at the UK's Manchester Metropolitan University, recently developed a Computing badge with 30 guides.
""I have a son in the Scouts and daughter in the Brownies and I noticed a difference in the technology-related badges on offer,"" she says.
""The Scouts badges seemed to get into the nitty-gritty of computing, while in the Guides the focus was more about online image and e-safety, so I felt it was important with this badge to drill deeper and include components on networks, data and algorithms.""
""Safe space"": Anita Tiessen, head of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts
While evolution is inevitable in an institution with a 100-plus year heritage, Ms Tiessen believes much of the progress in this area will be underpinned by the movement's core values of girl-led learning and leadership.
""In many countries around the world there are very few opportunities for girls to have that 'safe space' to develop their skills and leadership opportunities,"" she says.
""And with all the evidence pointing to girls holding back in more mixed environments, we are giving girls greater freedom to explore those things.""
Ever since a small group of girls gate-crashed the first ever Scout rally in 1909 demanding ""something for the girls"", girl guides have been challenging the status quo.
More power to their elbows.

"Lovefilm By Post DVD rental service to close
Lovefilm offered DVDs and Blu-rays to rent via post
The Lovefilm By Post DVD rental service will cease to operate on 31 October this year, its owner Amazon has said.
Amazon cited a ""decreasing demand"" for the discs and a growing number of customers who were streaming movies and TV series instead.
The move has irritated some fans, who argue that a wider range of films is available to rent on DVD and Blu-ray.
Lovefilm was founded in 2002 and acquired by Amazon in 2011, when it had more than 1.4 million subscribers.
For a monthly subscription fee, Lovefilm customers could receive a DVD or Blu-ray disc of their choice via post that they would send back once watched.
From 2010, some content could also be accessed via online streaming instead.
A spokesman for Amazon told the BBC it planned to donate Lovefilm's thousands of discs ""to charity partners"".
The spokesman did not say how many individual discs this amounted to, but he noted that Lovefilm's catalogue covers more than 80,000 titles.
""We have very much enjoyed delivering the Lovefilm By Post service to our customers,"" said Amazon in a statement.
""However, over the last few years we've seen a decreasing demand for DVD and Blu-ray rental as customers increasingly move to streaming.
""We are committed to finding alternative roles for all Lovefilm employees within Amazon.""
Some fans of Lovefilm were left disgruntled by the decision.
""It's not great, to be honest,"" customer Michael Harrison told the BBC.
He argued that there was a wider selection of films available to rent in physical form than with streaming services.
""You don't have to buffer it, or worry about pixelation,"" he added.
""I live in a small town and we don't have many shops around - it was great for me to get films posted to me.""
""Well, Amazon stopping its Lovefilm service is comfortably the worst news I've had this year.
""So many films not available to stream.""
for customers of Lovefilm, notifying them of the service's closure.

"Earth-i plans space video network
The new constellation would provide sub 1m resolution from an altitude of 500km
A British company has announced its intention to launch a big constellation of Earth observation satellites.
A prototype spacecraft will go up later this year for testing, with the expectation that a further five platforms will follow in 2019.
, based in Guildford, says its train of satellites will deliver rapid, high-resolution imagery of the planet in still and video formats.
At best resolution, these products will see features just under a metre across.
The video is promised in full colour. It could be used to track moving objects such as cars and other vehicles; or, if the scene is held fixed on a specific point, it would enable 3D models of the ground to be constructed.
Earth-i is already well established in the analytics business, processing and selling space pictures to a strong customer base. But this move, announced on the opening day of the biennial
, would see the company operate its own satellites as well.
Earth-i has produced this simulation of what the video would look like
These platforms are the fruit of an R&D project coming out of
The manufacturer has developed a new class of Earth observation spacecraft
The first in this series was built in just six months and was launched in 2015. The lessons learned from that experience were then applied to a second satellite which is now set to be the pathfinder in the Earth-i constellation.
Carbonite was conceived as a model for a quick-build, ultra-low-cost satellite
""We worked on Carbonite-1 with SSTL and studied the performance to help develop the technology for Carbonite-2 which we will be calling EiX2,"" explained Richard Blain, the CEO of Earth-i.
""As for the constellation, we will launch that in batches of five. And in terms of the architecture, our baseline plan is for the first batch to go into one orbital plane, and then for the following batches to go into different planes, so that not only do we get high-frequency revisit to places on Earth but we also get to see places at different times of the day.""
The total number of satellites in the constellation will depend on how the business for the pictures grows.
There is financial intelligence to be had from watching operations from space
Earth-i is chasing a burgeoning market that is attracting new types of customers who are only now beginning to understand the potential of daily, fast-turn-around imagery.
So, for example, whereas governments have long made use of Earth observation (EO) data for mapping towns and cities, to plan major infrastructure ventures and to track land-use changes - the likes of the financial sector is really just beginning to appreciate the intelligence value of space pictures.
Those who trade in commodities are now gaining insights on supply chains, and on the activities at particular factories, ports, mines and oil fields; activities that all have financial implications.
And just as satellite-navigation data - knowing where things are positioned in the world - has become a mainstay of the smartphone applications revolution, there is a feeling that the exploitation of EO data in this domain has barely scratched the surface.
This was part of the motivation for the UK government last year committing more money than any other member state to the Earth observation programme of the European Space Agency (Esa). There are big economic opportunities coming.
""There is an almost insatiable demand for data from space as people are realising its true value to both their planning and daily operations,"" said Josef Aschbacher, director of Earth observation at the European Space Agency.
""Higher resolution image data from commercial organisations is likely to be very valuable either in its own right or when used in conjunction with other data sources including medium-resolution image data such as that provided under the European Copernicus Programme.""
The city of Bristol: Earth-i distributes pictures from SSTL's DMC3 satellites
Earth-i's constellation would be the first European system to provide HD video of activity on the ground.
Two North American companies have already started doing this -
, and US firm Terra Bella (recently acquired by
Earth-i currently exploits the imagery coming from
. The capacity on this trio of spacecraft, which take 1m resolution pictures, is wholly leased by a
. Earth-i is the Beijing companyâ€™s international distributor.
Richard Blain would not discuss the detail of the financing of the new constellation but said that a number of contracts were in place with SSTL.
""We are a well funded private company with a clear financial roadmap, supported by world class professional advisers and with a number of financial instruments at our disposal in order to ensure the continued successful deployment of our constellation following on from the next prototype satellite due for launch later this year,"" he told BBC News.

"New York investigates company accused of selling fake Twitter followers
New York's chief prosecutor says the state is opening an investigation into a firm that allegedly sold millions of fake followers to social media users.
""Impersonation and deception are illegal under New York law,"" said Eric Schneiderman.
The company, Devumi, stands accused of stealing real people's identities, which it denies, according to the New York Times.
The paper linked the ""follower factory"" to a host of celebrity accounts.
, including interviews with people who alleged their account details and profile pictures had been copied to create realistic ""bots"".
It is alleged that others who wanted to increase their follower count, including actors, entrepreneurs and political commentators, could then pay to be followed by the bots.
On social media, high follower accounts boost influence, which can impact public opinion, or bring advantages, such as job offers or sponsorship deals, to account holders.
Mr Schneiderman said he was concerned that such ""opaque"" operations were undermining democracy.
The growing prevalence of bots means that real voices are too often drowned out in our public conversation. Those who can pay the most for followers can buy their way to apparent influence.

End of Twitter post 2 by @AGSchneiderman
On its website, Devumi offers customers the chance to order up to 250,000 Twitter followers, with prices starting at $12 (£8.50). Clients can also buy ""likes"" and retweets.
The company sells followers on a range of other platforms, including Pinterest, LinkedIn, Soundcloud and YouTube.
""Devumi has helped over 200,000 businesses, celebrities, musicians, YouTubers and other pros gain more exposure and make a big impact to their audience,"" says its website.
The company is registered at a New York City address, although the New York Times alleged it is a front, with its actual offices in Florida and it also employs workers in the Philippines.
Twitter has responded to the investigation, saying it is working to stop Devumi and similar companies.
The tactics used by Devumi on our platform and others as described by today's NYT article violate our policies and are unnacceptable to us. We are working to stop them and any companies like them.
— Twitter Comms (@TwitterComms)
End of Twitter post by @TwitterComms
In the past, Twitter has been accused of not taking the problem seriously enough. It has often dismissed bot investigations as ""inaccurate and methodologically flawed"".
The platform does allow automated accounts, but it strictly prohibits them being bought or sold. It says it will suspend accounts that are found to have purchased followers, retweets or likes. However, a representative told the New York Times it rarely does this in practice, as it is hard to prove.
The report alleges that Devumi has a stock of at least 3.5 million automated accounts, many of which are sold repeatedly.
It alleges at least 55,000 of the accounts ""use the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users, including minors"".
""These accounts are counterfeit coins in the booming economy of online influence, reaching into virtually any industry where a mass audience — or the illusion of it — can be monetized. Fake accounts, deployed by governments, criminals and entrepreneurs, now infest social media networks,"" they wrote.
Whose accounts have been linked?
The New York Times found many well-known Twitter accounts have followers from the Devumi ""factory"". It said the company's clients covered the political spectrum, from liberal cable pundits to a reporter at the right-wing site Breitbart and an editor at China's state-run news agency, Xinhua.
Entrepreneur and member of the UK's House of Lords
Martha Lane Fox's Twitter account showed ""a series of follower purchases spanning more than a year"", including a 25,000-follower boost days after she became a Twitter board member in April 2016. She told the New York Times a ""rogue employee"" was responsible.
The investigation showed Devumi-managed bots following Paul Hollywood's official Twitter profile. Shortly after the paper emailed him to ask questions, his account was deleted.
The CNN contributor has paid for over 500,000 Twitter followers - although most have been deleted. She said it was ""an experiment I did several years ago to see how it worked"".
US ironworker turned politician
On Saturday, Mr Bryce - who is trying to unseat Republican Paul Ryan in Congress - said, on Twitter, that he bought the followers as an experiment in 2015, when he was a blogger.
Yup, three years ago, I had a blog and decided to try it. I spent about $15. Didn’t work and haven’t done it on my campaign.

"Jimmy Choo bought by Michael Kors in £896m deal
Luxury shoemaker Jimmy Choo has been bought by Michael Kors Holdings in a deal which values the firm at about £896m.
The British firm, which was put up for sale in April, had attracted attention from a number of suitors.
As well as shoes, Jimmy Choo produces a range of luxury goods, but has seen sales slow in recent years.
Under the terms of the agreement, Jimmy Choo will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Michael Kors.
Mr Kors himself, the honorary chairman and chief creative officer of the firm that bears his name, described the purchase as ""a premier fashion luxury house that offers distinctive footwear, handbags and other accessories"".
He added: ""We admire the glamorous style and trendsetting nature of Jimmy Choo designs. We look forward to welcoming Jimmy Choo to our luxury group.""
The sale plan was backed by Jimmy Choo's main shareholder, JAB Holdings, owned by the German billionaire Reimann family.
Michael Kors Holdings said the acquisition was expected to deliver a number of benefits, including ""the opportunity to grow Jimmy Choo sales to one billion"" and ""a more balanced portfolio with greater product diversification"".
It said Jimmy Choo would also have the opportunity to grow in the men's luxury footwear category, as well as greater exposure to global markets, ""particularly the fast-growing market in Asia"".
The firm was co-founded by Malaysian shoemaker Jimmy Choo, who trained at the renowned Cordwainers Technical College in London, and former Vogue journalist Tamara Mellon in 1996.
It quickly built up a dedicated client list of musicians, actresses and royalty. The Duchess of Cambridge is a fan of the British shoe designer, as is singer Beyonce and Oscar winning actress Emma Stone.
But it has gone through a number of different owners over the years. Ms Mellon and the first of several different private equity suitors bought out Mr Choo in 2001.
Ten years later, Ms Mellon left the business to launch her own clothing line. In 2014, Jimmy Choo listed on the London Stock Exchange, by which time JAB, owned by the German billionaire Reimann family, was the main shareholder.

"Will Gompertz reviews Charles II: Art & Power ★★★★☆
There is something hauntingly contemporary about this exhibition.
It starts with a disgruntled England, which has made a cataclysmic decision to break with an imperfect but effective Europe-entwined institution that has been the basis for the country's social, economic, and political life.
We'd be better off without 'em, is the feeling.
The Irish and Scots are not so sure, but the will of a group of charismatic and self-righteous metropolitan politicians prevails, and people are warily readying themselves for a collective leap into the dark.
The population is divided on the matter, split like a pair of cheap trousers.
The fact is this scepter'd isle is going to be run differently from now on.
We stand poised. It is mid December. But we are not in 2017.
We are in 1649 and, like it or not, the country is going to be a republic. The old monarchical system along with its network of tactical intercontinental marriages is over. Oliver Cromwell and his New Model Army rule, ok.
Charles I, by Edward Bower, is the first painting in the exhibition
Which brings us to the first painting in the show where we meet Charles I shortly before his execution, commissioned, apparently, by Cromwell and his chums. The incarcerated King looks wizard-like, nonchalant, and inwardly majestic.
It is a respectful seated portrait suggesting the God-fearing Parliamentarian was uncomfortable doing away with a man widely believed to be hot-wired to God.
It didn't stop him, though. As we see in an explicitly detailed image called The Execution of Charles I. This gory print became an instant blockbuster; a bloodthirsty hit both at home and throughout an intrigued and amazed Europe.
Alongside it is a copy of a small book with a big title, Eikon Basilike: The Pourtraicture of His Sacred Majestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings.
This is important. It is basically a mix of memoire, prayer, and personal statement, probably - but not definitely - written by Charles I shortly before his public beheading at Whitehall.
What is certain is the date of its publication ten days after the event, when it quickly became a bestseller and in-turn a cunning piece of beyond the grave Royalist propaganda.
Maybe the King wasn't so bad after all.
Maybe he was a martyr. And look at that lovely little woodcut image of him blessing his divine son as his chosen successor. The Restoration had begun in people's minds less than two weeks into the new Commonwealth.
The exhibition then jump cuts to 1660 and the return of the exiled Charles II.
The Coronation of King Charles II in Westminster Abbey, by Wenceslaus Hollar
Backed with parliamentary cash, the soon-to-be crowned King has been out on a shopping spree to replace all the regalia and formal royal tableware Cromwell had melted down and flogged off.
It is a fine line the young man has to walk. His purchases need to be glitzy enough to impress and cement his status and legitimacy. But they can't be as flashy as the stuff his French cousin Louis XIV buys because: a) it might go down badly with the public and cost him his head, and b) he can't afford it.
He opts for silver gilt, which nearly 360 years later still looks magnificent. The craftsmanship and quality of the plates, candlesticks, chalices, and salts are impressive. As is an exquisitely embroidered bible given to the newly restored King, signalling a more liberal, post Cromwellian, era.
The brakes are off. Theatres are re-opened.
Charles II, painted by John Michael Wright, is a powerful image of the monarchy restored
Charles II takes on a coterie of lovers (including the saucily depicted actress Nell Gwyn), and poses for a huge portrait by John Michael Wright.
What the painting lacks in terms of technique - which is quite a lot - it more than makes up for with size and visual impact. It is designed to establish the new King as the top man. We see him sitting in an elevated position, wearing the crown of state, and sporting his Order of the Garter costume under Parliament robes. He is holding his newly acquired orb and sceptre.
The idea is to hark back to Tudor and Elizabethan styles to imply stability through continuity. Frankly, he looks ridiculous; like an aging rock-star who has been allowed to rummage around in the royal dressing up box.
Leonardo da Vinci's Oak and dyer's greenweed, from circa 1505-10
It sums up what quickly becomes apparent in this show, which is Charles II was not blessed with the same curatorial eye as his late father. OK he acquired some wonderful drawings by Leonardo, Michelangelo and Holbein - some of which are on display.
But when it came to the task of retrieving the great paintings Cromwell sold off, or commissioning new pictures, he comes up short.
He did make a few decent purchases.
The Massacre of the Innocents by Pieter Bruegel the Elder
You'll see a very good Pieter Bruegel the Elder painting called The Massacre of the Innocents. Although, it is slightly odd in so much as there are no innocents being massacred.
There were originally, but when the Habsburg Emperor, Rudolf II, owned the painting he recognised the occupying troops as his own (specifically depicted as such by Bruegel, who was making a political point) and had all the dead babies painted out. The upshot is a scene in which women are bent over, crying their eyes out over loaves of bread and various poultry.
If you're after an exhibition stuffed to its royal gunnels with painterly masterpieces, the chances are you'll be underwhelmed by Charles II: Art & Power and should wait until January when the Royal Academy will do what he didn't and reunite much of his father's collection.
If, however, you are in the market for a richly told, thought-provoking history lesson that feels surprisingly relevant in today's Brexit Britain, with the added bonus that its central protagonist looks like Brain May from Queen, then you might consider the £11 ticket price as money well spent.

"Nine ways to organise your life in your lunchtime
Technology of Business reporter
Busy tech entrepreneur and mum Colleen Wong likes any apps that can save her time
With two children under the age of four and a tech start-up to run, Colleen Wong has her hands full.
She is happy to use any technology that can help her manage her hectic lifestyle, including family activity planning app Hoop and food-sharing service Olio.
""I will embrace any tech that offers practical benefits and can save me time,"" says Ms Wong.
A finalist in the Women Who Tech European Start-up Challenge, she runs her child tracker firm, TechSixtyFour, from her home in Teddington, Middlesex.
She is typical of a new breed of hi-tech mums and dads around the world using lunchtime ""life hacks"" to juggle work and family commitments.
So what useful apps that could help you take back control of your life?
Fed up of washing and ironing? Try a laundry app such as FlyCleaners in New York, or Laundrapp, available in UK cities such as London, Glasgow and Harrogate.
The FlyCleaners app is free to use and offers an overnight service for when you need clean clothes fast.
Just pick a slot and hand your washing over to a FlyCleaners representative as little as 20 minutes later.
Washing and pressing one shirt in Chelsea, Manhattan costs $2.99 (£2.34), and deliveries are free when you spend more than $30 (£23).
With Laundrapp, booking the 48-hour service is also free, while prices depend on your location and the load.
Getting five shirts washed and pressed in south London, for example, costs £11.
Organising who does what around the house can be a chore in itself, but with US firm FamilyTech's apps Mothershp and Choremonster, you can set jobs for each member of the family from your office.
The Choremonster app enables parents to give rewards to kids who help around the home
FamilyTech co-founder Chris Bergman says: ""With Mothershp, parents set chores and rewards. Their child then logs into Choremonster, where they can earn rewards such as 'screen time', and unlock monsters, for completing those chores.""
Both apps are free to use and are available worldwide in eight languages.
Wherever you live, you can use your lunch hour to plan evening meals using a home cooking app such as BigOven.
Features on the free app, which is available around the world, include a grocery list organiser and more than 350,000 recipes.
If you want access to money-saving tips and nutrition tools, you can also sign up for the ""Pro"" version costing $19.99 a year or $1.99 a month.
Once you've planned your meal, you could order the ingredients from independent retailers using a locally focused app such as Epicery. It launched a one-hour delivery service in Paris last year.
Deliveries cost from €2.90 (£2.46) up to €6.90 (£5.89) if you order produce from three or more of its 250 members, which include local butchers, fishmongers and off-licences.
French local food delivery app Epicery plans to expand throughout Europe
""Our aim is to expand into several other French and European cities soon,"" says Doriane Raffin at Epicery.
Then if you have food left over, why not ""freecycle"" it, rather than throw it away, using a UK-based app like Olio? It enables families and local business owners to redistribute food and other household items that would otherwise go to waste.
The free app is a hit with Ms Wong, 40.
""Food waste drives me mad, so I love Olio,"" she says.
Choose your next holiday destination
Free 360-degree virtual reality (VR) tours are the new way to plan your next holiday from your desk.
All you need is your smartphone and the website of a VR specialist such as Ascape VR or YouVisit and you can escape into another world on your lunch break (with or without a VR headset).
Travel site Ascape specialises in 360-degree videos of holiday destinations
Valeriy Kondruk, chief executive of Ascape VR, says: ""Working in an office, you spend 90% of your time reading and writing.
""Taking a virtual trip is a great way to switch off and really get personal with a destination.""
With online marketplace TaskRabbit you can tackle all those odd jobs you never seem to have enough time to do, from clearing the loft to fixing that leaky tap. Simply choose a ""tasker"" based on experience, reputation and hourly rate.
Once the job is done, pay securely via the app, which is currently available in 23 cities across the US, as well as in London.
Elsewhere, ServisHero is one of the most popular apps for Singapore residents in need of a handyman.
Its users describe what needs doing, wait for the quotes to roll in, and then pick a ""hero"" to do the job.
You can find fun family activities in minutes with free apps such as the UK's Hoop and Yuggler in the US.
Hoop users can set filters to find nearby events that suit their children, and can share those they find interesting with their friends.
You can plan family activities using apps like Hoop and Yuggler
""I use Hoop to do last-minute planning on where to take the kids,"" Ms Wong says.
Yuggler, which is only currently available on iOS devices, offers similar features in US cities including San Francisco and Philadelphia. It is planning to expand into 22 more cities soon.
Apps such as DocTap and iCliniq offer a way for busy professionals to get medical advice without taking time off.
ICliniq users can set up a video consultation with one of its 2,000 or so doctors in countries including the US, India and Germany.
And with London-based DocTap, you can pay £24 for 15-minute face-to-face GP appointments at clinics and pharmacies around the UK capital.
DocTap user Jamie Ritchie says: ""It was pretty much impossible to fit an appointment with my local doctor around work.
""With DocTap, I got an appointment at lunchtime, and was back in the office within half an hour.""

"Bruno Mars grabs (nearly) all the Grammys - but where were the women?
Bruno Mars accepts his Grammy for album of the year
Bruno Mars and Kendrick Lamar stole the show, and most of the awards, at the 2018 Grammys.
Mars provided the night's big upset, taking the album of the year trophy that most critics assumed would go to Lamar's rap tour de force, Damn.
In the end, voters found Mars's crowd-pleasing R&B more palatable, while Lamar dominated the rap categories.
Alessia Cara won best new artist - making her the only female artist to win a major prize.
Stars like Lady Gaga, Kesha, Lorde and SZA were overlooked, with only 17 awards (out of a total of 86) going to women or female-fronted bands.
Kesha's performance was an emotional highlight of the show
The imbalance was particularly incongruous on a night that highlighted the #TimesUp and #MeToo campaigns.
Most performers arrived for the show
to symbolise their support for the movements, which address sexual harassment and inequality.
Pop star Kesha also gave a powerful, stirring performance of her single Praying, which addresses her own experience of surviving abuse.
She was backed by an all-star choir, including Cyndi Lauper and Camila Cabello, who were dressed in white to reflect the white rose campaign.
""We come in peace but we mean business,"" said R&B star Janelle Monae, introducing the performance.
""To those who would dare try to silence us, we offer two words: Time's Up.
""We say Time's Up for pay inequality, discrimination or harassment of any kind, and the abuse of power.""
""Let's work together, women and men, as a united music industry committed to creating more safe work environments, equal pay, and access for all women.""
Handwritten notes to the victims in Las Vegas and Manchester were displayed on screens
The night's other pivotal moment was a tribute to the music-loving victims of the tragedies in Manchester and Las Vegas.
Handwritten notes bearing the names of the dead were projected on the stage as country music stars Maren Morris, Eric Church and Brothers Osborne performed Eric Clapton's Tears In Heaven.
All three acts played at the Route 91 festival last October before a gunman opened fire on the audience, killing 58.
""All of country music was reminded in the most tragic way then connection we share with fans and the loving power that music will always provide,"" said Eric Church, choking back tears.
""We wanted to come together and honour the memory of the beautiful, music-loving souls so cruelly taken from us,"" added Morris.
Bruno Mars - That's What I Like
The War On Drugs - A Deeper Understanding
Mars left with six trophies in all, including the three biggest prizes: Album of the year, song of the year and record of the year.
Speaking onstage, he paid tribute to his fellow nominees, saying: ""You guys are the reason why I'm in the studio pulling my hair out"".
He also told the story of how, as a 15-year-old in Hawaii, he performed in a show called The Magic of Polynesia, singing songs by R&B writers Babyface, Jam & Lewis and Terry Riley.
""I'll be honest, I was incredible at 15,"" he laughed, before explaining how he'd wanted to recapture the sounds of those 80s and 90s hits on his latest album.
""Those songs were written with nothing but joy... and that's all I wanted to bring with this album. Hopefully I could feel that again and see everybody dancing and everybody moving.""
As well as the star's own prizes, his recording engineers won a further award for their work on the album.
Kendrick Lamar's opening number was a powerful, highly-conceptual performance
His victory robbed Kendrick Lamar's more urgent, political album of the night's main prizes - but the Compton-born star still took home five trophies, including best rap album, best rap song and best rap performance.
He also opened the ceremony, in New York's Madison Square Gardens, with a provocative, politically-charged performance that featured contributions from U2 and Dave Chapelle.
""I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America,"" observed Chapelle in the middle of the segment.
Lamar's victories came at the expense of rap veteran Jay-Z and his soul-baring album 4:44.
Jay-Z won none of his eight nominations and chose not to perform at the three-hour show. But Lamar tipped his hat to the elder star, declaring ""Jay for president!"" as he collected the best rap album award.
The night also saw performances from Lady Gaga, Sam Smith, Pink and Patti LuPone, who sang Evita's Don't Cry For Me Argentina as part of a tribute to Andrew Lloyd Webber.
Ed Sheeran, who could not attend the ceremony, won two prizes - best pop vocal performance for Shape Of You and best pop album for Divide.
There were also posthumous awards for Leonard Cohen and actress Carrie Fisher, who won best spoken word album for the audio version of her memoirs, The Princess Diarist.

"Why are TV singing contests still a thing?
Pitch Battle's judging panel will include Kelis and Bebe Rexha - who sang vocals on David Guetta and Nicki Minaj hit Hey Mama
Pitch Battle will become the latest singing contest set to hit our TV screens this summer but, 16 years on from ITV's Popstars, why is the format still so strong?
Putting Kelis, Gareth Malone, Chaka Khan and Mel Giedroyc together in the same room is, quite simply, a magnificent idea.
Having clearly recognised this, BBC One has duly
this dream team to appear in its upcoming singing contest Pitch Battle.
Judges Kelis and Malone will be joined by a different guest judge each week, which will see Chaka Khan rotate with Will Young, Bebe Rexha and Seal to critique the contestants.
Choirs and a capella groups will be pitted against each other in a format you just might recognise from the many, many other talent show formats which have preceded it.
""I remember seeing Popstars back in 2001 and it being a genuinely fresh and exciting idea,"" says Julia Raeside, TV critic for The Guardian.
Hear'Say, made up of (l-r) Noel Sullivan, Suzanne Shaw, Myleene Klass, Kym Marsh and Danny Foster, won the first series of Popstars in 2001
""To watch the hopes and dreams of these young kids, it didn't feel quite so manipulated back then, and the concept of a judge being a bit of a villain was relatively new.""
But, perhaps inevitably, the success of the show sparked a new wave of singing contests such as Popstars: The Rivals, Pop Idol, The X Factor and The Voice.
A number of successful groups and singers such as Girls Aloud, Little Mix, Leona Lewis and Olly Murs came out of these shows over the years - but there were also plenty of potential careers which never took off.
The Observer's pop critic Kitty Empire says: ""If you are an artist, quite often going on TV talent shows might not be the best idea for your career, because for every One Direction there are a thousand No Directions.
""If you want a career in music, that sometimes doesn't happen as a result of going on a talent show. However, if you're more versatile and more willing to go on the West End stage, you can certainly turn the TV exposure to your advantage.""
It's true - there are plenty of contestants who applied for talent contests as singers, and ended up taking their careers in totally different directions after receiving the TV exposure.

Rylan-Clark Neal was something of a novelty act in the 2012 series of the show, but has gone on to be a successful TV presenter and even released an autobiography last year.
Elsewhere, 2005 X Factor winner Shayne Ward and Popstars' Kym Marsh can now be seen acting in Coronation Street.
While Marsh's bandmate Myleene Klass is now a radio presenter and X Factor 2008 victor Alexandra Burke has starred in multiple theatre productions.
Certainly some of these former contestants have had success, but Empire points out: ""There is a wider issue of whether great art is being made.
""For a country that produced people like David Bowie, who is universally acclaimed, we're not seeing that quality of talent on TV shows.
""People are just entertained by these programmes, and a singing contest is something that lends itself to TV watching by all generations. It gets kids and grandparents in front of the TV, in an age when most people are on YouTube.
""So it's much more about the format being successful TV than it is about creating meaningful musical careers.""
A successful TV format it clearly is, but it's perhaps surprising that 16 years on from Popstars, singing contests continue to dominate TV schedules.
Girls Aloud formed after winning Popstars: The Rivals in 2002
""I understand the heavy reliance on singing contests - the idea that a show needs a result to make you tune in for the next instalment,"" Raeside says.
""But I think it's a shame that, by now, light entertainment producers haven't come up with something to replace it.
She adds: ""I used to work in TV development, and the wheels do tend to move quite slowly.
""Back then, they were trying to work out what was going to be the next Big Brother. Similarly, these singing shows have a shelf life, and some would argue they've already reached their sell by date.""
Empire agrees: ""Increasingly now the talent show formula can get a little tired, and I think many people have realised winning these shows perhaps isn't always the best thing to do.
""In Britain we particularly embrace this format, partly because we love an underdog story, like Paul Potts [the mobile phone salesman who won the first series of Britain's got Talent].
""In America, the underdog stories don't play so well - it's the shiniest people with the straightest teeth who wins. Whereas in Britain we love unlikely success stories, so it really serves our market.
The Pitch Perfect films sparked renewed interest in a capella singing
Looking ahead to Pitch Battle, Raeside says she can see the appeal of using choirs instead of individual singers to attract viewers and thinks it's a good way to get more mileage out of the talent show format.
""There was something quite shrieky about a show like The Voice, because it's one singer trying to make their mark in a 90-second audition, and there's something unrelaxing about watching that,"" she says.
""When you watch a choir it has a much more positive feeling, so it could have the edge over a show where teenagers are trying to get their break.""
Empire agrees that, on paper at least, Pitch Battle ""looks like it's a winner"".
""Before Glee, it was a very American phenomenon, but now people getting together and harmonising doesn't seem like such a weird thing to do anymore,"" she says.
""The idea that there will be choirs and a capella groups battling it out means that you're getting quite a variety of people into the TV studio, and presumably they'll be doing mash ups and cover versions, so I can see how the format has been thought up to appeal to the broadest audience.""
But, Raeside adds: ""I don't know how much longer these shows can keep going for. I can't see where else they'd take this format now, it feels like we're coming to the end of the line.""

"Fully funding IVF would improve safety for mothers, experts say
Full government funding for IVF treatment would reduce the risk of harm to mothers and babies and save the NHS money, health experts have said.
It would help lower cases of women who have more than one embryo transferred into the uterus, which can cause risky multiple pregnancies, their study says.
Multiple pregnancies are the ""greatest avoidable risk of IVF"", it says.
The Department of Health said the NHS should be offering IVF for all patients who meet existing criteria.
Multiple pregnancies are the most common adverse outcome of IVF treatment. They can happen when more than one embryo is transferred into the uterus.
This procedure is often carried out to reduce costs for patients who pay for their own treatment, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) report said.
Multiple pregnancies are associated with a six-fold increase in the risk of pre-term birth - a leading cause of infant mortality and long-term mental and physical disabilities - as well as increased risks to mothers, such as pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and haemorrhage following birth.
But despite the risks of them occurring, double embryo transfer during IVF treatment continues.
The RCOG paper found that almost one in five IVF deliveries in the UK in 2011 involved a multiple birth.
Sweden has similar live birth rates but a high proportion of single embryo transfer, but during the same period the multiple birth rate was 4.9%.
In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF)
An egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory
The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to develop
IVF worked for the first time on 10 November 1977. On 25 July 1978, the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born
On average, IVF fails 70% of the time
The highest success rates are for women under 35
On average, it takes almost four-and-a-half years to conceive with IVF
Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK
Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend government funding for three full IVF cycles.
However, the recommendations are not binding and it is up to local NHS providers to decide what to offer.
The RCOG said there was a ""postcode lottery"" for funding across the country and six out of 10 IVF cycles in the UK were funded by patients themselves.
It said it was still widely believed by patients and health professionals that the success rate of IVF treatment was higher following the transfer of two embryos than with one embryo.
But the college said studies had shown that in women with a good prognosis, single embryo transfer is comparable to that of two embryos and with a significantly lower risk of multiple pregnancy.
It called for the a national commissioning policy to remove the current variation in IVF funding.
Mr Tarek El-Toukhy, consultant gynaecologist and specialist in reproductive medicine and surgery, and lead author of RCOG's report, said: ""The health and financial burden it places on women, families and the NHS cannot be overstated.
""To ensure rates of multiple births remain low, there is little doubt that the single most important factor that could enhance the acceptance of single embryo transfer among patients and practitioners is appropriate funding for IVF treatment.""
Keith Reed, chief executive of the Twins and Multiple Births Association, said healthcare organisations needed to ""step up their efforts to address the risks associated with multiple birth pregnancy"".
""There is a growing body of evidence that good care and following multiple birth guidance during maternity reduces the poor outcomes and need for neonatal care which put pressure on NHS services.""
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""As this report itself highlights, we have made great progress in improving patient safety by lowering the national multiple birth rate in IVF from 24% in 2009 to 11% today.
""We know fertility problems can have a serious and lasting impact on familiesâ€”and the government has been clear that the NHS should provide access to IVF for all patients that meet the criteria set out in NICE guidance.""

"Caitlyn Jenner: 'I'm upset with Trump and could enter politics'
Caitlyn Jenner hopes to show people who transition 'it will be OK'
Reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner says she is considering entering US politics in a bid to promote transgender issues.
she had been ""really upset"" by some of President Donald Trump's policies on the LGBT community.
The ex-Olympic athlete, who changed her name and transitioned to living as a woman aged 65, said Mr Trump was being ""influenced by people around him"".
Jenner said her life was ""much simpler"" now she was living openly as a woman.
Over the past two years, Jenner has become the most famous transgender person in the world.
A Republican supporter who supported Mr Trump in last year's US election, Jenner said she was disappointed the new president had overturned guidance allowing transgender students to use school toilets matching their gender identity.
""It doesn't make me regret my vote yet, but it is very disappointing and I have been very verbal about that,"" she said.
""I thought Trump would be better on these issues.""
Asked why she believed that, she said it was because she had ""talked to him"", adding: ""I will have more conversation with him about it in the future.""
A former athlete, Jenner won gold at the 1976 Olympics
She told the programme she was now considering going into politics to promote LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) issues.
""I do a lot of political stuff, but it is mostly all behind the scenes,"" she said.
Asked if she would stand for election, she added: ""I have been asked that question quite a bit, to be honest with you - over the next year I'm looking into it.
""I want to know where can I do a better job for my community, in bringing the Republican Party around when it comes to all LGBT issues.
""Is it from the outside? Kind of working on the outside and the perimeter and working with everybody to get the Republicans to change their thinking?
""Or is it better off being on the inside and actually running for a Congress or Senate seat? Can I do more good there? And those are the things that I am evaluating.""
Jenner with her family after transitioning
Won a men's decathlon gold medal at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, breaking the world record
Became a TV sports commentator, lectured, and published several books
Married Kris Kardashian in 1991, later gaining fresh fame in the popular reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians
Announced in 2015 that she identified as a woman and two months later revealed she wanted to be referred to as Caitlyn
She is the most prominent athlete to publicly come out as transgender
A reality series documenting her transition, I Am Cait, was screened in July
She has six children with three ex-wives, including daughters Kylie and Kendall Jenner, and four step children with Kris Kardashian, including Kim, Kourtney and KhloÃ© Kardashian
In a wide-ranging interview, she also spoke about how some of her 10 children and step-children have grown closer to her since transitioning, while others have become more distant.
Jenner said some of her children were mourning the ""loss of Bruce"", the name she lived by before transitioning.
'My children are dealing with the loss of Bruce'
But she said step-daughter Kim Kardashian had been ""wonderful"" about the subject.
She spoke about how she had maintained Jenner's secret for two years before she transitioned.
""She came up to me one day, after she had moved out and had her own house, and said: 'What the hell is going on with you?'
""And at that time I thought 'it is time to start talking', so I said 'I'll come to your house tonight'.""
Her step-daughter, now married to rapper Kanye West, then kept the secret quiet for another two years, without ever bringing it up again, Jenner said.

"Arrested Development: The show that can't be cancelled
Arrested Development is returning for a fifth series next year.
The cult US TV show first aired nearly 15 years ago but was cancelled in 2006 after getting poor ratings.
It continued to find fans online, though, and after a seven year hiatus it was revived in 2013 as the first original comedy Netflix ever made.
There were then four more years of silence from the show's creators - until now. Here are some of the reasons it keeps coming back.
13 Reasons Why is getting a second series
Stranger Things star on faith and bisexuality
Thumbs up for new rating system on Netflix
Critics have called it the 'greatest sitcom ever'
. Which is quite an achievement for a comedy that's still never found mainstream popularity.
Despite struggling to attract viewers, Arrested Development has also been named by both
as one of the best things to have ever been on TV.
It's the story of a wealthy family who're wrapped up in a scandal and lose everything.
The show follows their attempts to live without money.
It helped launch the careers of some big stars
You're most likely to know Michael Cera from films like Superbad, Juno and Scott Pilgrim vs The World.
But before all these he'd perfected his bumbling, innocent act in Arrested Development. He was just 15 when he was cast as George Michael Bluth.
Jason Bateman plays George's Michael's dad - who, confusingly, is called Michael Bluth. He's since become a Hollywood mainstay, in films like Horrible Bosses and Central Intelligence.
In fact, so many of the show's stars went on to big things that when it was brought back in 2013 it was a struggle getting them in the same room at the same time.
This is thought to have forced producers into a
style change - which meant each episode in series four followed an individual character.
It looks like this has been sorted for series five though. The show's official Twitter account tweeted: ""This time the Bluths are all together. Whether they like it or not.""
The US remake of House of Cards was the only show on Netflix's books when it got involved with Arrested Development.
Back in 2013, the streaming service was mainly known for sending DVDs in the post - not for producing original content.
about all fifteen new episodes of series four being released simultaneously.
""Don't feel obligated to watch it all at once,"" creator
, ""It's a comedy! It's not like Lord of the Rings. Comedy takes a lot out of you.""
It's moving with the times
Arrested Development has always been highly political - with jokes directed at the elite in America.
It doesn't look like that's changing this time around. The show's creator has already taken a dig at US President Donald Trump.
""We all felt that stories about a narcissistic, erratically behaving family in the building business - and their desperate abuses of power - are really under-represented on TV these days,"" Mitchell Hurwitz says.

"Steven Soderbergh's 'Mosaic' puts together intriguing puzzle
Updated 1512 GMT (2312 HKT) January 22, 2018
Paul Reubens, Sharon Stone in 'Mosaic'
""Mosaic"" takes its name seriously, putting together a picture with a shifting series of pieces, as the perspective shifts from one character to another. In that, this HBO drama from director Steven Soderbergh essentially takes a pretty conventional murder mystery, dresses it up with a gimmick and comes away with a pretty compelling if somewhat conventional story.
The aforementioned gimmick involves an app made available in advance of the show, allowing viewers, as HBO puts it, to choose which characters to follow and ""build their own experience from the material created and curated by Soderbergh and [writer Ed] Solomon.""
Interactivity of this sort has long been discussed, and it's becoming more practicable. Still, as drama ""Mosaic"" ultimately has to stand on its own, especially for those who aren't interesting in availing themselves of the ""Col. Mustard in the snow-covered cabin with a candlestick"" add-ons.
Fortunately, what emerges is solidly executed, with a good, ever-changing cast, kicking off with Sharon Stone as successful children's author Olivia Lake. A bit of a Norma Desmond type, the lovelorn Olivia takes in a young aspiring artist (""Mudbound's"" Garrett Hedlund), before snapping when she discovers that his interest in hanging around her sprawling winter wonderland might not be romantic.
Sharing her insecurities with a friend (Paul Reubens), Olivia quickly launches into another relationship with Eric (Frederick Weller), who harbors his own shadowy motivations, before abruptly going missing. That, in turn, leads to a police investigation, as the focus shifts again -- to Eric's sister (Jennifer Ferrin), and a cop (Devin Ratray) she enlists to help her -- with Soderbergh and Solomon (""Men in Black"") keeping viewers guessing about whether this was simply a crime of passion or might be associated with a larger, more elaborate and nefarious plot.
Because the characters and perspective keep shifting, ""Mosaic"" benefits from what amounts to binge viewing, and HBO is breaking form a bit by displaying the program on its linear channel in that fashion: the six-part series will air over five successive nights, with the last two installments playing back to back.
Granted, ""Mosaic"" isn't as groundbreaking or novel as its purveyors might like people to believe, but it reflects Soderbergh's desire to play with the TV form, an approach he has brought both to his increasingly frequent forays into television, with ""The Knick"" and ""Godless"" as predecessors.
The underlying conceit of ""Mosaic"" is tied to the notion of TV consumption increasingly being a two-screen experience, tapping into viewers' appetites for additional content to augment passive viewing. That's all to the good, but still only works if the pixels that go into the main picture -- as this one mostly does -- adds up to being one worth watching.
""Mosaic"" premieres Jan. 22 at 8 p.m. on HBO. Like CNN, HBO is owned by parent company Time Warner.

"Amazon accuses Walmart of bullying in cloud computing clash
Walmart said there were cases in which it would not want its data on Amazon's cloud computing platform
Walmart, the US's biggest retail chain, has been accused of trying to coerce its technology suppliers into shunning Amazon's cloud computing service.
Amazon has accused its rival of attempting to ""bully"" the IT companies into picking a rival platform.
, which said other unnamed large retailers had also asked vendors to shun Amazon Web Services.
The row comes at a time Amazon is expanding its shopping operations.
Last Friday, the Seattle-based business announced a $13.7bn (Â£10.8bn) takeover of the groceries chain Whole Foods.
And this week it revealed it had struck a deal with Nike to sell the sportswear-maker's shoes directly, and that it was launching Prime Wardrobe - a service that lets customers order and try clothes for seven days before deciding which to buy and keep.
AWS was the most profitable part of Amazon's business in the last quarter
Amazon's Web Services division may not be as well known to the public as the company's retail operations, but it is a huge money-earner.
In April, the company reported the unit had generated $3.7bn in sales over the previous three months.
The business provides computing power, online storage, security protection and developer tools to third parties.
Its clients include Netflix, Airbnb, General Electric and the CIA.
According to market research company Gartner, AWS leads the market in its field.
However, Walmart uses Microsoft's rival Azure service.
A spokesman for Walmart acknowledged it had concerns about its suppliers' use of AWS.
""Our vendors have the choice of using any cloud provider that meets their needs and their customers' needs,"" he said.
""It shouldn't be a big surprise that there are cases in which we'd prefer our most sensitive data isn't sitting on a competitor's platform.""
Amazon suggested this approach was misguided.
""We've heard that Walmart continues to try to bully their suppliers into not using AWS because they have an incorrect view that AWS is somehow supporting Amazon's retail business,"" said a spokesman.
""Plenty of suppliers are standing up to Walmart and refusing to be told that they can't use [us].
""Tactics like this are bad for business and customers and rarely carry the day.""
AWS's use of encryption means that its own staff cannot peer into the data stored on its computer servers by its customers.
But one analyst said it was still understandable Walmart and others might not want to help send business its way.
Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods provides it with the supply chain to expand its grocery operations
""AWS is a separate part of Amazon's business, but ultimately this comes back to being frightened of being disrupted, especially in light of the recent acquisition of Whole Foods,"" said Nick McQuire, from the consultancy CCS Insight.
""The question is whether this fear now will cause a wider backlash among retailers, where you get many within the community switching from using AWS in the cloud to Google, Microsoft or someone else.""

"BBC star salaries to be revealed
The salaries of the BBC's biggest stars are expected to be revealed in the corporation's annual report when it is published later.
It's the first time - and probably the only time - this information will be made public.
The review will be published at 11:00 BST and details of anyone earning more than £150,000 a year will be included.
The report will also look at TV and radio viewing figures, as well as online engagement.
It may also examine the issue of the competition, such as Netflix.
What exactly is the BBC's annual report?
It looks back over the previous year's performance and publishes details about the corporation's finances and spending. This year's edition could prove more interesting than most.
Why are they revealing star salaries?
It's all down to the government's culture secretary, Karen Bradley.
, Mrs Bradley said publishing the salaries of stars earning more than £150,000 would bring the BBC ""in line with the civil service"" on transparency.
The culture secretary said it would help ensure the BBC ""produces value for money for the licence fee"" and that more transparency could lead to savings that could be ""invested in even more great programmes"".
But the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, has said: ""Our position on talent pay has not changed and all major broadcasters have questioned the merit of the proposal.
""The BBC operates in a competitive market and this will not make it easier for the BBC to retain the talent the public love.""
ITV's programmes chief, Kevin Lygo, also called the proposal a ""mean-spirited, nosey way of looking at things"" during last year's Edinburgh Television Festival.
The corporation already reveals the salary details of on-air stars who earn more than £450,000 and executives who earn more than £150,000.
Tony Hall, BBC director general, says publishing stars' pay details will be 'inflationary'
Who might be among the talent listed?
Presenters such as Graham Norton, Gary Lineker, Claudia Winkleman, Chris Evans, Fiona Bruce and Andrew Marr could easily be on the list.
The revelations are required under the BBC's new Royal Charter, and are expected to encompass more than 100 of its top stars.
According to last year's annual report, 109 TV and radio presenters earned more than £150,000 in the financial year 2015-16. But they were not named at the time.
Have the stars spoken out about the move?
Speaking at the China Exchange last month, Andrew Marr said of the plans to formally spell out pay: ""It's uncomfortable for all of us.
""I'm well paid but I'm much less overpaid, perhaps, than people working for rival organisations who won't go through this process,""
ahead of Karen Bradley's announcement last year: ""I'm all for it. I totally understand it. We're working for the public, so why shouldn't they know?
""It's good to see some women on the list too.
""We get paid an awful lot of money and it's a marketplace. It's bonkers.""
She added: ""I love working for the BBC. I know that commercial stations pay a whole lot more - double, three times, four times. But I totally understand why people would want to know.""
What else might come out of the report?
By revealing talent pay, we might also find out if there is any gender disparity.
We should also find out how the BBC's television and radio channels and stations have performed over the last year.
And it's also a chance to discover more about the BBC's audiences - who is tuning in to TV, radio and the websites, for instance. (The BBC is struggling to attract younger audiences, as it faces competition from YouTube, social media and gaming).
Trust issues in news and the rise of competition from the likes of
and Amazon Prime could also feature.
Will we find out star salaries every year from now on?
Not necessarily. From next year, some salaries may not be disclosed if the stars are employed by the newly-formed BBC Studios. This programme-making division is being turned in to a commercial operation and will operate and be treated in the same way as an independent production company.

"Amazon customers complain to Advertising Standards
The UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) is considering whether to launch a formal inquiry into delivery targets missed by online giant Amazon.
Amazon's top service, Prime, offers next-day deliveries for Â£7.99 a month.
The ASA told the BBC: ""We have received a handful of complaints about Amazon parcel deliveries and we are at the initial assessment stage.""
An Amazon spokesman told the BBC: ""We can confirm the ASA is not currently investigating.""
The ASA said there had been five complaints since the start of the month.
Amazon offers free delivery above a certain minimum spend, but express, unlimited delivery for Prime customers.
It also offers this coming Saturday, 23 December, as its final order date for Christmas orders, three days later than the Wednesday offered for non-Prime customers.
Amazon advises customers to contact customer services if they do not receive a parcel by the estimated delivery date.
The consumer rights group Which? points out that a company missing its delivery date is in breach of contract.
It says that consumers have the right to terminate the purchase and get a full refund in that instance.

"A Liberal Democrat leader's battle for attention
Parliamentary correspondent
Sir Vince Cable's problem is crystallised at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons.
He doesn't get much of a look-in.
Theresa and Jeremy have crossed swords, senior backbenchers on the government and opposition sides have spoken, the SNP's Ian Blackford has had his two questions, and then finally, as the session extends well beyond its once-normal half hour, with MPs drifting from the chambers to bag an early place in the canteen queue, the leader of the Liberal Democrats is called.
A bully pulpit it's not. A single question at the fag end of an extended PMQs is not a commanding position from which to address the nation.
But, in parliamentary terms, this is as good as it will get for Sir Vince.
With just 12 MPs, his party is no longer entitled to more than a minimal slot at PMQs, and comes well down the pecking order in all the other parliamentary occasions, too. Worse, MPs seldom see the need to hang around to listen to what it has to say.
Outside Westminster, the same problem is manifest.
The start of Liberal Democrats' conference week was overshadowed by Boris Johnson's Brexit eruption. The end of the week will be dominated by Theresa May setting out her vision of Brexit in Florence.
Sir Vince's speech was even blown off 24 hour news by President Trump's appearance at the UN.
That's showbusiness. So how does a fourth party leader gain that most precious of political commodities - attention?
His predecessor, Tim Farron, never quite managed it, either in the Commons or outside.
A Lib Dem leader, typically, has to spend the first couple of weeks of a general election campaign introducing themselves to voters, who may not even be aware of their existence.
Mr Farron spent those vital days side-tracked into discussing his evangelical Christian views on gay sex. After that his moment was lost.
Can I commend to Sir Vince a possibly unwelcome role model: David Owen?
Former leader Tim Farron never quite won the battle for attention inside or outside Parliament
Having refused to join in the SDP's merger with the Liberals, and more recently having backed Brexit, the Doctor is not remembered with affection in Lib Dem circles, but bear with me.
In the mid-1980s, he kept the SDP, with just six MPs, in the national spotlight by sheer force of personality.
He offered a combination of eye-catching ideas and a shameless ""anytime, anyplace anywhere"" willingness to appear on the media, plus (and this is critical) he always had something interesting to say.
Sir Vince has many of the ingredients necessary to repeat this performance. Like Dr Owen, he has few visible means of political support - but he does have a level of public recognition as a former cabinet minister, and from his appearance on Strictly.
More important, he has the credentials to speak on the big issue of the day, and be listened to. In the 1980s, as the Cold War moved towards its end, Dr Owen could speak about the nuclear balance of terror and relations with the Soviet Union.
Post-referendum, Sir Vince can speak, with the authority of a former business secretary, about the implications for industry of the UK's future relations with the EU.
And more than that, as an ex-member of the coalition cabinet, he knows the key players in the Conservative government and can find the pressure points in their internal debate on Brexit.
The parallels don't end there. With no internal rivals in his party, Sir Vince has considerable freedom of action - so he has a lot of room to be as pungent and as radical as he wants.
He can be a bruiser. His wounding zinger to then Prime Minister Gordon Brown, noting his transformation ""from Stalin to Mr Bean"", was one of those rare parliamentary put-downs that did real damage.
Speeches like this one can matter.
Lib Dem insiders believe Nick Clegg's resignation speech in 2015, with its robust defence of liberalism, helped attract thousands of new members. They hope that if their new leader finds the right words, that could happen again.
Sir Vince may not appreciate comparison with Lord Owen
Sir Vince's deadpan Yorkshire delivery is probably better suited to one-liners than 10-pagers, and he did indeed offer some effective-looking one-liners.
His speech also offered policy nuggets to groups of voters such as greens, pensioners and internationalists.
But to reach their target audience, he needs an effective social media presence - so one of his key tasks will be to assemble a team capable of putting his message across online.
Was it wise to revisit the coalition and student debt? Sir Vince worked hard to exorcise the ghosts of the coalition era in general, and the policy U-turn on student tuition fees in particular, but he was the minister who proposed the coalition's tuition fee increase to the Commons, and reminding people of it may simply bring a fading issue back to mind.
His calculation must be that the Lib Dems' electoral rivals will certainly remember, and are bound to throw tuition fees at him.
Plus, some of the Commons constituencies the Lib Dems hope to gain or regain are university seats - hence the section about his work with the National Union of Students to find a way forward on student finance, and hence his proposal to ""support all young people in future with an endowment or learning account, which they can use at any stage in lifeâ€¦ helping to finance further or higher education, either at the post-18 stage or later in life"".
He also toyed with replacing the existing loan scheme with some form of graduate tax.
The central theme was his opposition to Brexit.
As the Lib Dem USP, it didn't work - much - at the last election. But Sir Vince is doubling down and continues to offer voters ""an exit from Brexit"" via a referendum on the final deal with the EU.
He delighted his conference by describing the Brexiteers as ""silly public schoolboys reliving their dormitory pillow fights"".
And his money quote - ""We will be denounced as traitors and saboteurs... but if the definition of sabotage is fighting to protect British jobs, public services, the environment and civil liberties, then I am a proud saboteur,"" - positions his party to capitalise if the government (or Labour) stumbles or splits over Brexit.
That is the big strategic judgement, or maybe gamble, in this speech, whatever else it has to say about housing, green issues or President Trump.
Sir Vince's signature has appeared on a number of Commons amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill from Conservative Remainers and Labour's active pro-EU faction.
I doubt he anticipates a flock of defections from either side - but he has shown he's willing to co-operate across party lines, and in the long term that may widen cracks in Tory and Labour unity.
But it is also telling that there is not much sign of MPs from elsewhere signing Lib Dem amendments at the moment - and if the truth be told, the diminished strength of the Lib Dems would provide a rather fragile lifeboat for any pro-EU Conservative or Labour MPs.
If there is indeed to be an ""anti-Brexit people's liberation front"", it is a long way from materialising.
Building on his much-mocked comment that he could yet be prime minister, he ended his speech with the hope that his party could once again challenge for a place in government.
For that to happen he also needs luck. Consistent success in council elections is all very well, but he really needs a run of by-elections in winnable Commons seats to show that the Orange Army is back in the game.

"Carillion: Regulator was warned over pensions deficit
The Pensions Regulator was twice asked for help in getting Carillion to pay more into its pension schemes in the years running up to its collapse.
Letters published by Parliamentary committees show the construction firm's pension trustees wrote to the regulator in 2010 and 2013 to flag up problems.
The regulator has been criticised for failing to take early action to protect pensioners.
However, it said it did get Carillion to raise its pension payments in 2013.
, it had only £29m of cash left and a pensions deficit liability of about £2.5bn, according to MPs on the Work and Pensions Committee and the Business Committee.
In 2010, trustees had written to the Pensions Regulator saying that while they had advised Carillion that it needed to pay a minimum of £35m a year to help clear the pensions deficit, the maximum offered by the firm was £25m. The trustees deemed this ""not acceptable"".
The 2013 letter said trustees wanted contributions of £65m a year over 14 years, but the company had offered £33.4m over 15 years. The trustees said they had reached an ""impasse"" with the firm and wanted ""intervention"" from the regulator.
The chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, Frank Field MP, said: ""These letters suggest the Carillion directors were contemptuous of their pensions obligations.
""Their private pleading that the company could not afford more was in stark contrast to the rosy picture - and bumper dividends - being presented to the outside world.
He added: ""With characteristic alacrity, the Pensions Regulator started its arduous process of chasing money down from Carillion a few days after it was formally announced there was no money left. I can only assume - and hope - they are going after some of those very generous bonuses.""
In response, the Pensions Regulator said: ""When the trustees wrote to us in 2013 to say they could not agree funding plans with the company, we did intervene by threatening to use our powers unless a funding plan was agreed.
""Our intervention resulted in a significant increase in the amount of money the company was prepared to pay into the scheme. We believed this was reasonable, based upon our understanding of the company's trading strength as set out in its audited accounts.
""The investigation we have now launched is looking at whether there are grounds to use our anti-avoidance powers.""
On Monday, the Official Receiver - the body in charge of liquidating Carillion - said a further 152 workers would be made redundant this week, taking the total number of jobs lost to 1,141.
The failure has also led to job cuts and widespread disruption among sub-contractors.

"Commuters braced for rises in regulated rail fares
Millions of rail users in the UK are bracing themselves for news of an increase in regulated rail fares from January 2018.
Train operators are allowed to raise fares by as much as the Retail Prices Index (RPI) figure for July, expected to be in the region of 3.5%.
The exact figure will be published later this morning.
Passenger groups said commuters would be worst-hit, and suggested that the RPI measure should be scrapped.
The rises will affect ""anytime"" and some off-peak fares as well as season tickets in England and Wales.
In Scotland, it is mainly commuters who will be affected, with off-peak fares rising by a smaller amount.
The Scottish government currently limits rises in off-peak fares to RPI minus 1%.
There are no plans for increases in Northern Ireland.
Unregulated fares, which include super off-peak travel and advance tickets, will be set in December.
Transport Focus, which represents the interests of passengers, said rail users were already fed up with getting poor value for money.
Analysis: Richard Westcott, transport correspondent
Oh the irony... Regulated fares were meant to be the government's way of stopping private rail firms from overcharging passengers.
They apply to tickets where people don't have much choice but to go by train: commuting into big cities, for example.
But for many years, ministers have deliberately used the system to put prices up anyway. Why? Because they want passengers to pay a bigger chunk of the rail bill, so that the government pays less.
Fares used to account for about half the cost of running our trains. Today it's about 70%.
It does mean, of course, that people who don't commute by train, which is most of the country, pay less to subsidise the system.
But that's little consolation to workers who've faced consistent price rises that have often outpaced their salary. Even allowing for inflation, rail fares have gone up by about 25% since the mid-1990s.
I've spoken to many passengers - often young people at the start of their careers - who're on the brink of changing jobs because they can't afford the increases.
""Wages are not keeping pace with inflation and performance remains patchy,"" said a spokesperson for the group.
""Passengers, especially commuters, face potential strike action, the consequences of the continual rise in passenger numbers, and disruption caused by railway upgrades.""
Transport Focus said it would also like to see the RPI measure replaced by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), which is currently running at 2.6%.
CPI is typically lower than RPI.
However the government said the fare increase was justified by improvements to the network.
""We are investing in the biggest rail modernisation programme for over a century to improve services for passengers - providing faster and better trains with more seats,"" a spokesperson for the Department for Transport said.
""We have always fairly balanced the cost of this investment between the taxpayer and the passenger.""
The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said there would be an extra 170,000 seats for commuters by the end of 2019.
The Department for Transport also rejected the idea of using CPI to determine price rises.
It said RPI was used across the rail industry - for example in calculating the cost of running train services.

YouTube punishes Logan Paul for 'suicide forest' video
by Jackie Wattles and Brian Stelter
January 10, 2018: 9:15 PM ET
YouTube star sorry for filming suicide victim
YouTube is punishing one of its most popular creators, Logan Paul, after he posted footage of a dead body to his channel.
The video hosting site said Wednesday that it's ""decided to remove Logan Paul's channels from Google Preferred,"" a designation that helps advertisers identify YouTube's top-performing channels.
Anyone can set up a YouTube channel and post videos, but the company only lets certain prominent creators into its special program for advertisers.
Paul -- whose channels have a combined 20 million followers -- will also be booted off ""Foursome,"" a web series in which he appeared previously.
That show airs on YouTube Red, the site's premium subscription service. The company also said a YouTube original movie he was slated to appear in, ""The Thinning: New World Order,"" has been put ""on hold.""
At the heart of a scandal is a video Paul posted more than a week ago that showed a corpse hanging from a tree in Japan's Aokigahara forest, also known as ""suicide forest.""
The video was widely seen, and many users were outraged. Paul took the video down and apologized, saying he ""didn't do it for the views.""
""I did it because I thought I could make a positive ripple on the internet, not cause a monsoon of negativity...I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention and while I thought 'if this video saves just ONE life, it'll be worth it,' I was misguided by shock and awe, as portrayed in the video. I still am,"" he said in a
Related: Amid Logan Paul controversy, YouTube explores 'further consequences'
YouTube also issued a statement last week.
""Our hearts go out to the family of the person featured in the video. YouTube prohibits violent or gory content posted in a shocking, sensational or disrespectful manner. If a video is graphic, it can only remain on the site when supported by appropriate educational or documentary information and in some cases it will be age-gated,"" the statement read.
At the time, YouTube issued a ""Community Guidelines strike"" against Paul. Channels that receive three such strikes in a three-month period can be
But the company faced further backlash for not taking stronger punitive action against Paul.
YouTube hinted Tuesday that it planned to change that.
""It's taken us a long time to respond, but we've been listening to everything you've been saying,"" the company said in a series of tweets. ""We know that the actions of one creator can affect the entire community, so we'll have more to share soon on steps we're taking to ensure a video like this is never circulated again.""
YouTube's upload-anything-anytime ethos is constantly being challenged as videos containing graphic or inappropriate content continue popping up on the platform. The company has at times struggled to enforce its policies prohibiting violent and gory videos.
graphic videos are only permitted to remain on the site if they offer ""educational or documentary information.""
In the same statement, YouTube said it ""acted accordingly"" in response to Paul's post.

Athletics world records set before 2005 could be rewritten
European Athletics will make proposals to governing body IAAF
Seb Coe says it is ""step in right direction""
It is a proposal which has been described as ""cowardly"" by one former athlete, but as a ""step in a right direction"" by the most powerful man in athletics.
In a ""revolutionary"" new proposal, European Athletics has recommended that all track and field world and European records set before 2005 should be removed from the record books.
It would mean Mike Powell's long jump world record, Florence Griffith-Joyner's 100 meter and 200m world records and Britain's Paula Radcliffe's marathon world record would be scrapped.
Usain Bolt's world records, set after 2005, would still stand.
Radcliffe, who set her world record of two hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds in 2003, described the proposal in a statement as cowardly and said that it would damage her ""reputation and dignity.""
But Seb Coe, president of the sport's governing body -- the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) -- told reporters the report was a ""step in the right direction.""
He added: ""If organized and structured properly we have a good chance of winning back credibility in this area.""
Mike Powell broke Bob Beamon's 23-year-old long jump world record by 5cm, leaping 8.95 m (29 ft 4 in) at the World Championships in Tokyo in 1991.
'Cloud of doubt hung over records for too long'
European Athletics' Council accepted the proposals of the taskforce set up in January to look at the credibility of world records. It is a response to the McLaren report which uncovered widespread doping in sport, with track and field particularly affected.
Svein Arne Hansen, European Athletics president, told reporters that records were ""meaningless if people don't really believe in them.""
Under the proposals, world and European records would only be recognized if certain criteria were met:
Records would have to have been achieved at international events where the highest standards of officiating and technical equipment could be guaranteed.
The athlete must be subject to an agreed number of doping control tests in the months leading up to the record.
Doping control samples taken after world-record performances would need to be stored and available for retesting for 10 years.
The IAAF has stored blood and urine samples only since 2005. Current records which do not meet the above criteria would remain on the ""all-time list"" but would not be officially recognized as records.
Should world records set before 2005 be scrapped?
""It's a radical solution for sure, but those of us who love athletics are tired of the cloud of doubt and innuendo that has hung over our records for too long,"" said Hansen. ""We need decisive action to restore credibility and trust.
""This will now go to the IAAF Council Meeting in August and on behalf of European Athletics I will be encouraging them to adopt this proposal.""

"Ethical hackers to boost NHS cyber-defences
About one-third of UK health trusts were caught out by the WannaCry ransomware worm
centre that will oversee the health service's digital defences.
It will employ ""ethical hackers"" to look for weaknesses in health computer networks, not just react to breaches.
Such hackers use the same tactics seen in cyber-attacks to help organisations spot weak points.
In May, one-third of UK health trusts were hit by the WannaCry worm, which demanded cash to unlock infected PCs.
In a statement, Dan Taylor, head of the data security centre at NHS Digital, said the centre would create and run a ""near-real-time monitoring and alerting service that covers the whole health and care system"".
The centre would also help the NHS improve its ""ability to anticipate future vulnerabilities while supporting health and care in remediating current known threats"", he said.
And operations centre guidance would complement the existing teams the NHS used to defend itself against cyber-threats.
NHS Digital, the IT arm of the health service, has issued an invitation to tender to find a partner to help run the project and advise it about the mix of expertise it required.
Kevin Beaumont, a security vulnerability manager, welcomed the plan to set up the centre.
""This is a really positive move,"" he told the BBC.
Many private sector organisations already have similar central teams that use threat intelligence and analysis to keep networks secure.
""Having a function like this is essential in modern-day organisations,"" Mr Beaumont said.
""In an event like WannaCry, the centre could help hospitals know where they are getting infected from in real time, which was a big issue at the time, organisations were unsure how they were being infected"".
In October, the UK's National Audit Office said NHS trusts had been caught out by the WannaCry worm because they had failed to follow recommended cyber-security policies.
The NAO report said NHS trusts had not acted on critical alerts from NHS Digital or on warnings from 2014 that had urged users to patch or migrate away from vulnerable older software.

Energy company Total has agreed to buy Maersk's oil business in a $7.45bn (£5.8bn) deal.
It will see French firm Total take control Denmark's Maersk's assets in the UK sector of the North Sea, including the Culzean gas field.

Actress Meg Tilly attends a special screening of the Netflix original film ""War Machine"" at The Metrograph on May 16, 2017 in New York City. (Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images for Netflix)
Tilly stopped acting to raise her kids
She's back opposite Brad Pitt in ""War Machine""
Meg Tilly had three very good reasons for dropping out of the Hollywood spotlight.
The actress was riding high in the 1980s and '90s with roles in films like ""The Big Chill"" and ""Leaving Normal"" when she left the industry to raise her kids. (Tilly shares a son and daughter with producer Tim Zinneman, and another son with actor Colin Firth.)
""I couldn't be gone six to nine months from my children's lives,""
""I had a challenging childhood, so I didn't feel like I could trust somebody else to raise them.""
""My children didn't ask to be born,"" she added. ""I had a responsibility to be there.""
Tilly, who moved to Canada with her children, also stayed busy over the years writing books, including some romance novels.
More recently, she's been edging her way back to acting with roles on stage and the Canadian TV drama ""Bomb Girls.""
Tilly currently appears as Brad Pitt's wife in the Netflix series ""War Machine,"" and notes that at 57, she is older than the 53-year-old Pitt.
""It's unheard of though, right,"" she said. ""At the screening, women kept coming up to me and saying how much they appreciated an age-appropriate wife for the female lead.""
The actress said Pitt was so good at donning gray hair for his role as a general that she had forgotten he is a heartthrob.
""I was shocked when he came to the wrap party,"" she said. ""I'm like, 'Holy cow, that's Brad Pitt!'

"Wilko opens redundancy talks with nearly 4,000 staff
Wilko has more than 400 stores across the UK, including this one in Oakham
High-street retailer Wilko has begun a redundancy consultation with nearly 4,000 staff members as it reorganises its business.

"Amsterdam wins bid to host EU medicines agency post-Brexit
Amsterdam has won a vote to host the European Medicines Agency (EMA) which will relocate from London after the UK leaves the European Union.
The UK is losing both the EMA and the European Banking Authority (EBA) which employ around 1,000 people.
Ministers from the 27 EU countries remaining in the bloc after the UK departs in 2019 have taken part in the secret ballot.
They will now vote later on the new home for the EBA.
Some 16 cities bid for the EMA, while eight want to host the EBA - Brussels, Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris, Prague, Luxembourg City, Vienna and Warsaw.
The EMA is the more alluring of the two bodies, as it promises to make its new host into a hub for Europe's medical industry.
The city that won the EMA must then drop out of the running for the banking authority.
Slovakia had been campaigning hard to make the case for relocating the EMA to Bratislava. Following its failure to win, diplomats say Slovakia may seek to cushion the blow by seeking support for its finance minister becoming chair of the Eurogroup, which runs policy for the eurozone.

The Soyuz-2 spacecraft with Meteor-M satellite was launched from Vostochny
Russia has lost contact with a weather satellite just hours after its launch from a new cosmodrome.
""Contact has not been established because it is not on its planned orbit,"" the space agency Roscosmos said. The Meteor-M satellite was carried on a Soyuz rocket.
The launch was at 14:41 (05:41 GMT), from Vostochny cosmodrome in Russia's far east. It is only the second launch from the base, which opened last year.
Smaller satellites were also on board.

"Is Lorde criticising the Grammys?
According to reports, Lorde was the only album of the year nominee not to be invited to perform at the Grammys
Lorde has highlighted the Grammys' lack of recognition for female artists in a full-page newspaper advertisement.
The star attended Sunday's ceremony, where only 17 of the 86 winners were women, or female-fronted acts.
Grammy president Neil Portnow provoked further criticism by saying women needed to ""step up"" if they wanted recognition.
In her letter, Lorde thanked fans ""for believing in female musicians,"" adding: ""You set a beautiful precedent.""
Although she did not directly criticise the awards, the statement could be read as a response to the controversy.
: 'Thank you, also, for believing in female musicians'
— Shayne Currie (@ShayneCurrieNZH)
End of Twitter post by @ShayneCurrieNZH
The 21-year-old added she'd seen ""a lot of crazy wonderful things"" at the ceremony, saying she ""almost cried"" after meeting Stevie Nicks and noting that ""Jay-Z's hands are really soft"".
The pop star had already been dragged into the debate over female representation at the Grammys when it emerged she was the only album of the year nominee who was not invited to give a solo performance.
, the pop star was asked to perform with other artists - possibly as part of a tribute to the late Tom Petty - but declined the offer.
saying: ""If you're debating whether or not I can murder a stage... come see it for yourself.""
The Grammys has been criticised for the lack of recognition for female artists, after several groundbreaking, critically-adored albums were shut out.
The 2018 Grammys in 90 seconds
Confessional R&B star SZA, who went into the ceremony with five nominations, left empty-handed; while Kesha, whose album Rainbow is a powerful document of surviving emotional and physical abuse, was beaten by Ed Sheeran in the pop categories - despite giving what many declared to be the night's key performance.
Asked about the gender imbalance, Portnow said: ""[Women] who want to be musicians, engineers, producers, and want to be part of the industry on the executive level [need] to step up.""
Condemnation came swiftly.
""Women in music don't need to step up. Women have been stepping up since the beginning of time,"" said Pink, who performed at Sunday's ceremony.
""Stepping up, and also stepping aside.
""When we celebrate and honour the talent and accomplishments of women, and how much women step up every year, against all odds, we show the next generation of women and girls and boys and men what it means to be equal.""
End of Twitter post by @Pink
Nine-time Grammy winner Sheryl Crow added: ""Who will young girls be inspired by.... when most every category is filled with men? I'm not sure it is about women needing to 'step up'.""
Lou Taylor, Britney Spears' business manager, put it more bluntly, saying Portnow ""needs to pull [his] head out of his ass"".
Portnow later apologised for his comments, saying the phrase ""step up"" had been taken out of context, and did not ""convey my beliefs"".
""Our industry must recognise that women who dream of careers in music face barriers that men have never faced,"" he continued. ""I regret that I wasn't as articulate as I should have been in conveying this thought.""
""I remain committed to doing everything I can to make our music community a better, safer, and more representative place for everyone.""
However, even his apology attracted criticism.
Recording Academy president Neil Portnow was condemned for his comments on the gender imbalance
""Neil Portnow and the Academy are the ones who need to step up,"" added Marcie Allen, a 24-year industry veteran. ""Women stepped up creatively big time in the past year - just look at Lorde, Kesha, SZA, St. Vincent, Taylor Swift, Pink, Cardi B.
""It's nice to see a lot of these accomplishments recognized in the nominations but it feels like there's something else holding women back structurally from succeeding in the music business,"" she added, pointing out there were only two female CEOs at major record labels.
""The bottom line is, you have to lead by example,"" she concluded. ""Literally no one asked for two very long segments [at the Grammys] featuring Sting and Shaggy that could have been given to Lorde or Kelly Clarkson or several other female artists who received nominations.
""They need to show the industry that those female artists and producers and executives are stepping up - but we need to be given an equal opportunity.""

"BBC to stream election debate via Twitter for first time
Viewers will be able to choose between watching the debate on television - or via Twitter
The BBC's election debate on Wednesday night and four other election specials will be streamed live on Twitter as well as broadcast on television.
It is the first partnership of its kind between the social network and the BBC.
A ""real-time curated timeline"" of tweets will bring commentary from BBC experts and BBC Reality Check to Twitter users.
One analyst suggested the move could help engage audiences who might be less likely to watch live TV.
The election debate will be broadcast live from Cambridge on BBC One from 19:30 BST until 21:00 BST.
Seven senior members of leading political parties will appear, including the Conservative Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Lib Dem leader Tim Farron.
Labour is yet to confirm who it will put forward for the debate.
""It's going to be reaching different audiences that wouldn't necessarily be watching live TV,"" suggested Tim Westcott, a television analyst at IHS Technology.

"How 'centaur teams' are speeding up drug discovery
Technology of Business reporter
Prof Hopkins likens scientists working with artificial intelligence as ""centaur teams""
Scientists working in tandem with artificial intelligence (AI) could slash the time it takes to develop new drugs - and, crucially, the cost - say tech companies.
Developing pharmaceutical drugs is a very expensive and time-consuming business.
, disappointing drug trials can knock millions off your stock market value in a flash.
So the faster we can identify promising molecules that could be turned into viable drugs, the better.
This is why pharmaceutical companies, such as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Merck, Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson, are now turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to help them.
Prof Andrew Hopkins is chief executive of Exscientia, an AI-based drug discovery firm that has recently signed a £33m deal with GSK.
He claims that AI and human beings working together in so-called ""centaur teams"" can help identify candidate molecules in a quarter of the usual time and at a quarter of the cost.
In Greek mythology, the centaur was half human, half horse - and very powerful and fast as a result. AI is giving scientists such extra powers, Prof Hopkins believes.
The mythical centaur was fast and powerful - half human, half horse
Successful drug discovery relies on precise understanding of how a disease affects our biological systems, says Pamela Spence, global life sciences industry leader at consultancy firm EY.
""Once that is known, scientists then search for molecules that can selectively interact with this 'target' and reverse that disruption or slow its impact - a 'hit' molecule,"" she explains.
Scientists often talk of a disease as the target and the molecule as a weapon being fired a it.
But this process of drug discovery - traditionally carried out by small teams of scientists painstakingly testing each potential target and hit molecule in the hope of finding a winner - is an enormously time-consuming approach that also has a very high failure rate.
So bringing in AI is like having a research assistant who can solve problems by systematic and relentless search at incredible speeds, she says.
More Technology of Business
""What might work - and equally importantly what might not work - can be identified first by the AI supercomputer 'in silico',"" she says.
This is the medical term for research carried out by computer, as opposed to ""in vitro"" - think test tubes - and ""in vivo"" - testing on animals and humans.
As carrying out human clinical trials accounts for the vast bulk of drug discovery cost, the sooner we can identify when something isn't going to work, the less money will be wasted.
""Then the physical testing can be done on a smaller number of potential new medicines... and a much higher success rate can be achieved,"" says Ms Spence.
Exscientia's AI algorithm crunches masses of data, from the structure of diseases to the efficacy of existing drugs, from peer-reviewed studies to observations of slides under a microscope.
Prof Andrew Hopkins thinks humans can work more efficiently using artificial intelligence
And all these possibilities are narrowed down in a process Prof Hopkins likens to natural selection.
""We're not trying to rule out the uncertainty - this is messy, dirty data,"" he says. ""There are very interesting analogies between how human creativity works and evolution.""
The aim is to come up with small molecules as candidates for up to 10 disease-related targets that can then be put through clinical tests.
""Every pill you make might cost pence to manufacture, but it's actually a precision-engineered product,"" says Prof Hopkins, who is also chair of medicinal informatics at the UK's Dundee University.
""There's an almost infinite number of other molecules it could have been. You have to make decisions as to what one might be safe and efficacious,"" he says. ""Most don't lead to anything.""
This AI-driven approach also makes it easier to come up with molecules that can have two distinct targets. For example, a cancer drug could also improve the immune system as well as tackle the disease.
GSK is getting behind the idea and has recently set up a discovery performance unit focused on enhancing drug discovery through the use of ""in silico"" technology - including AI, machine learning and deep learning.
AI-designed molecules need to be made and tested in the laboratory
The drive is being led by John Baldoni, GSK's head of R&D.
""We have a number of these deals that we are putting in place; the one with Exscientia is probably the one that's furthest along, but we have a few others in flow and a few internal projects ourselves,"" he says.
""The cost of discovery from target to launch is roughly $1.7bn [£1.3bn]. The cost of what we're talking about here, from target to clinic, is about 33% of that, and it takes about five-and-a-half years.
""Our goal is to reduce that to one year, and reduce the cost commensurate with that.""
AI is also finding its way into other aspects of the drug discovery process.
, for example, uses natural language processing to sift through published literature, such as chemical libraries, medical databases and scientific papers, to draw conclusions about possible new drug candidates.
Earlier this year, one of its candidates for a drug to treat motor neurone disease - also known as ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) - was found to prevent the death of motor neurones in cells taken from real patients, and delayed the onset of the disease in animals.
""We are incredibly encouraged by these findings,"" says Benevolent AI founder and chairman Ken Mulvaney.
Patients should be encouraged, too. AI-based drug discovery promises to bring more effective, cheaper drugs on to the market much more quickly.

"Uber boss takes stand at driverless trial
Ex-Uber boss Travis Kalanick has taken the stand at a trial accusing his former firm of stealing driverless car technology from Google's Waymo.
The San Francisco trial pits two of the biggest players in self-drive technology against each other.
Lawyers for Waymo pressed Mr Kalanick on allegations he orchestrated a theft of trade secrets from Waymo, via former Google employee Anthony Levandowksi.
They said Mr Levandowski visited Mr Kalanick while still working at Google.
Lawyers showed the jury an Uber visitor pass and notes, supposedly from the meeting, that contained the phrase ""laser is the sauce"" - a reference to the technology that was allegedly stolen - and meaning that Uber considered this critical to self-driving technology.
Mr Kalanick said he did not remember the meeting.
Mr Kalanick resigned as chief executive of Uber in June, following pressure from shareholders, but he remains on Uber's board.
The trial has provided another look at his win-at-all-costs attitude, which has been part-blamed for the troubles Uber experienced in recent years - from sexual harassment claims to court cases about the rights of its workers, regular clashes with city regulators and issues about how the firm looked after users' data.
In his opening argument, Alphabet lawyer Charles Veerhoven said: ""Mr Kalanick, the chief executive officer at the time at Uber, made a decision that winning was more important than obeying the law.""
Alphabet's case hinges on the fact that Uber hired Mr Levandowski, who had worked in the firm's self-driving car division.
It alleges that he had downloaded 14,000 files of data, including blueprints and other technical information about Lidar - which enables cars to understand their environment.
Mr Levandowski went on to found autonomous truck firm Otto, which was acquired by Uber less than a year later.
Uber does not dispute that the documents were taken but argues that it didn't gain anything from them.
The engineer at the centre of the row has pleaded the Fifth amendment - meaning he does not have to say anything that may incriminate him.
If found guilty, Uber could have to pay more than $1bn in damages or, in a worst case scenario, be forced to stop its self-driving programme altogether.

Bill Nye to Disney: You owe me $9 million for 'Science Guy'
August 25, 2017: 10:21 AM ET
Can Bill Nye's new show save the world?
Bill Nye the Science Guy has turned his attention to accounting.
The famed science enthusiast filed suit against
on Thursday, claiming the media giant hoodwinked him out of more than $9 million in earnings from ""Bill Nye the Science Guy.""
The beloved television series originally aired between 1992 and 1997, gaining a loyal following among children while winning multiple broadcasting awards for its fun, science-focused programming. It's still streamed on services like
Two decades after production wrapped up, Nye has accused Disney of fraud and breach of contract in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Disney subsidiaries including Buena Vista Television and ABC are also named as defendants.
Disney and the other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Related: It's been a tough year in the courtroom for media companies
The lawsuit claims that Nye, who was owed 16.5% of the show's profits, became suspicious after Disney-owned Buena Vista demanded he repay a large portion of his 2007 ""Science Guy"" earnings, citing an ""accounting error.""
Nye doubted the company's bookkeeping. But his efforts to engage the firm in negotiations to resolve the matter were ""futile,"" according to the lawsuit. Nye claims that Buena Vista stopped making royalty payments in 2008 because of the dispute.
Bill Nye has filed suit against Disney.
The suit says that Nye eventually hired an auditor to review the company's records, but the inquiry was delayed for years and the defendants allegedly did not provide all the requested documentation.
The ""defendants failed to engage in the process in good faith,"" says the suit, which accuses the companies of engaging in ""an ongoing, deliberate conspiracy to deceive Mr. Nye.""
According to the complaint, the limited documentation provided to auditors showed revenues were skewed and royalties went unreported.
Nye claims that he has suffered damages of at least $9.4 million, while the defendants enriched themselves with ""ill-gotten"" profits of over $28 million.

"DIY firms Homebase and B&Q; suffer sales slump
The UK's two biggest DIY chains, B&Q and Homebase, have both reported a slide in sales this summer.
B&Q said sales at its established stores fell 5% in the three months to July amid a drop in demand for garden furniture and other summer products.
The fall dragged shares in B&Q owner Kingfisher down 4.1%, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100.
Meanwhile, Homebase reported a similar drop in quarterly sales under its new Australian owner.
George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""It looks like Kingfisher isn't alone in having difficulties in the UK.
""The group's flagship B&Q chain saw like-for-like sales fall 4.7%, which is similar to the 4.3% fall at Bunnings UK, the new owner of Homebase.""
As well as the Bunnings DIY chain, Wesfarmers also runs the supermarket chain Coles and the Kmart and Target chains in Australia.

"Nine million people still make or receive calls while driving
Changes in the law have not deterred everyone from using their phones while driving
More than nine million people still illegally make or receive calls while driving, new research from the RAC suggests.
for the offence in March 2017, to six points and a Â£200 fine.
The motoring group has labelled the problem an ""epidemic"".
The research also found that 40% of drivers check texts, email and social media while sitting in traffic - despite the fact it's against the law.
More than 1,700 drivers were questioned in the survey - with 23% admitting to illegally making to receiving calls.
With 40m drivers in the UK, it would mean 9.2m people breaking the law in that way, if the results were extrapolated.
Only one in ten said they did not know about harsher penalties for being caught.
RAC road safety spokesman Pete Williams said: ""It is clear we have a hardcore of persistent offenders who believe they can get away with it.""
The number of people who illegally make or receive calls is falling - from 31% in 2016 to 23% this year.
Of those who were aware of the tougher penalties, 58% said they had never used their phone illegally behind the wheel.
Another 16% said they'd stopped completely since the law change.
Of the 15% of drivers who the RAC calls ""hardcore"" law breakers, 57% were men.
By Richard Westcott, Transport Correspondent
These numbers have fallen compared with last year, but the impact of doubling the punishment clearly hasn't deterred millions of drivers from breaking the law.
One in ten told the RAC that they did it because ""I can get away with it"", which is why the group says a big drop in traffic police numbers is partly to blame.
It's interesting how many people still check their phone whilst sitting still in traffic. The fact that nothing's moving clearly makes it feel safer - but beware, it is still illegal.
Last year, this survey had the state of the roads as drivers' number one worry. Now it's people using their mobile phones.
It's still OK if you have a proper hands-free unit.
The RAC report also raised concerns about the fall in the number of road policing officers, which it described as a ""massive"" 30% between 2007 and 2016.
Mr Williams says the RAC fears the problem of mobile use may get worse as a result of this fall.

De Niro: 'Godfather II' was good for me
Robert De Niro discusses his prep for the 1974 film 'The Godfather: Part II'
De Niro will screen the first two 'Godfather' films during the Tribeca Film Festival
When Robert De Niro landed the role of the young mob boss Vito Corleone in the 1974 film ""The Godfather: Part II,"" he said he approached it like a ""scientific experiment."" Performing a part first played by Marlon Brando, De Niro explained, required serious study.
""I went with Gray Frederickson [film producer] up to the Gulf and Western Building -- which is now the Trump Tower -- and went up to one of the screening rooms on the 28th floor and had an old video camera and videotaped all of Brando's scenes,"" De Niro recalled to CNN. ""I took those and I studied those.""
The actor went on to win an Academy Award for his performance, making Brando and De Niro the only people to win Oscars for playing the same character.
Although De Niro had appeared in films before ""The Godfather Part: II,"" the project catapulted his career. More hits followed for him, including ""Taxi Driver,"" ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Raging Bull.""
""'Godfather' was the first that I remember, movie, that was like a big blockbuster,"" De Niro said. ""Then came other movies. I might have this wrong, like some of the Spielberg films and so on, but when ['The Godfather: Part II'] came, I said this might be a good chance that it'll be a success.""
De Niro had originally auditioned for the role of Sonny Corleone in ""The Godfather,"" but the part went to James Caan.
""I don't know where I'd be,"" De Niro said.
As the co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival, De Niro plans to commemorate the 45th anniversary of ""The Godfather"" with a screening of the first two films in the franchise on the festival's closing night.
De Niro said he hasn't seen the movies in years and plans to watch all six hours and 19 minutes.
""What happened when we had 'Goodfellas' and 'Taxi Driver' [reunions], they pull you inside. You do the introduction, and they pull you inside and interview the cast while the movie is going on,"" De Niro explained. ""I wanted to get the experience with the audience, in this kind of setting.""
Seems only right to grant the Godfather this favor.

"Jeremy Corbyn aide David Prescott suspended from job
David Prescott joined Jeremy Corbyn's office as an aide over a year ago
A key aide to Jeremy Corbyn, and the son of former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, has been suspended from his job.
David Prescott is being investigated by the Labour leader's office after he was suspended a few days ago, the BBC understands.
It comes amid widespread allegations of misconduct at Westminster.
No formal complaint has been made to the Labour Party, which declined to give a reason for the suspension.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: ""We do not comment on staffing matters.""
The BBC has been told his suspension relates to his ""employment"" after allegations were received by Mr Corbyn's office.
The nature of the claims have not been disclosed.
A former BBC TV senior producer, Mr Prescott joined the Labour leader's office over a year ago, initially as a speechwriter before becoming a communications manager to the shadow cabinet.
He stood as Labour's candidate in Gainsborough in the 2015 election, but lost to Conservative's Sir Edward Leigh.
Earlier this year, Mr Prescott failed to become an MP for Hull West and Hessle after former home secretary Alan Johnson announced he was standing down in June's election.
Mr Prescott has been approached by the BBC for a comment.

"MPs to debate 'scrap first-past-the-post' call
The 2017 general election ended in a hung parliament - as was the case in 2010
Another bid to scrap the UK's first-past-the-post voting system will be debated by MPs on Monday.
More than 100,000 people signed
to adopt proportional representation for general elections.
Campaigners argue that the current system is meant to deliver decisive results but the 2010 and 2017 general elections resulted in hung parliaments.
The government says the 2011 AV referendum shows the public do not want to change first- past-the-post.
Under first-past-the-post (FPTP), the candidate who receives the most votes in a local constituency wins a seat in the House of Commons.
This means the number of seats each political party wins does not reflect its share of the vote nationally - in 2015, UKIP picked up 3.9m votes but only won one seat.
Under proportional representation (PR), parties' seats in parliament would be allocated in proportion to the number of votes cast for them.
The government argues that the current voting system is easily understood and provides a clear link between MPs and their constituents
The e-petition argues that the current system makes Parliament ""unrepresentative"".
The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for change, says the argument that FPTP brings decisive results has been undermined by recent elections and points out that proportional systems are used in the Welsh Assembly, Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly.
History of voting system changes
Royal Commission recommends the Alternative Vote system be adopted for elections to the Commons, although some argue for the Single Transferable Vote (STV)
MPs reject STV in a free vote but back AV for rural, single member seats. The changes are blocked by the House of Lords
Minority Labour government attempts to introduce AV in a third of constituencies but loses power before it can become law, after which electoral reform becomes a cause mostly associated with the Liberal Party
The Jenkins Commission recommends a proportional system should replace FPTP in Westminster elections
Northern Ireland Assembly formed - members elected under Single Transferable Vote system, a form of PR
Britons switch to the ""closed party list"" PR system to elect members of the European Parliament, having previously used FPTP
First elections to Holyrood and Welsh Assembly using ""additional member"" system - FPTP constituencies and seats filled proportionally from regional party lists
STV introduced for Scottish local elections
AV referendum - 19m voters - 68% of those who took part - reject bid to switch to new system
The Electoral Reform Society says the 2011 referendum should not be seen as a rejection of proportional representation - as PR was not offered as an option.
Instead the referendum offered voters a choice between keeping the current system or switching to the Alternative Vote - under which voters could rank candidates in order of preference, and these preferences could be used to decide the outcome in places where no candidate wins more than 50% of votes cast.
But in its response, the government says it has ""no plans"" to change the voting system and the 2011 referendum produced a ""clear result"" in which ""the public voted overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the FPTP system"".
The government argues that PR voting would ""weaken the direct constituency link which is a key feature of our Parliamentary system"" and that it would be ""more complicated for the voter"".
Any petition on the UK Parliament's website with more than 100,000 signatures is automatically considered for a debate in Westminster Hall, an annexe to the main Commons chamber which does not have the power to make law.

"'Pink slime': Meat processer seeks $5.7bn in defamation case
'Pink slime' had been common in fast food restaurants and grocery stores before the TV reports
A trial has begun in South Dakota over a meat processer's claim that it was defamed by ABC News reporting that dubbed its product ""pink slime"".
Beef Products Inc (BPI) argues ABC and its journalist ruined its reputation in 2012 reports on ""lean finely textured beef"", as the industry calls it.
BPI says ABC's ""disinformation campaign"" caused the meat processer's revenues to drop by 80%.
They are suing ABC for up to $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) in damages.
During a hearing in January, a lawyer for BPI told the judge that ABC had engaged in ""fake news"".
In the reporting by ABC's Jim Avila, the term ""pink slime"" was used 137 times, as he described the process which creates it.
The beef trimmings are placed in a centrifuge in order to separate the lean meat from fat, before it is treated with ammonia to remove bacteria.
The term ""pink slime"" was coined by Gerald Zirnstein, a former Agriculture Department scientist, who initially used it in an email to colleagues in 2002.
Grocery stores across America dropped products containing ""pink slime"" after the ABC reports aired.
The processed trimmings were also once found in fast-food served by McDonald's, Taco Bell and Burger King.
BPI, which primarily produces the beef trimmings, shut down three of its four production plants following the reports.
ABC lawyers argue they are protected under the US constitution's first amendment, which ensures a free press.
The television network, which is owned by Walt Disney Company, argues that BPI must prove ABC's reporters acted with ""actual malice"" to harm the company.
""We believe in the principle that people deserve to know what's in the food they eat and are confident that when all the facts are presented in court, ABC's reporting will be fully vindicated,"" said Kevin Baine, a lawyer representing ABC.
The trial in the rural town of Elk Point, population 2,000, just north of BPI's headquarters, is expected to last eight weeks.

"Hull's City of Culture events 'raise bar for successor'
Hull's Weeping Window poppies were seen by 720,000 visitors
More than 1.4m visitors attended cultural events and activities in Hull during the first three months of City of Culture, a report has revealed.
Hull University's interim findings show a third of this figure included visits to the city's museums and galleries.
UK City of Culture Independent Advisory Panel Chairman Phil Redmond said ""it raised the bar"" for its 2021 successor.
Hull was awarded City of Culture status in November 2013, beating competition from Swansea, Leicester and Dundee.
The interim report states nine in 10 residents had ""attended or experienced a cultural event or activity as part of Hull UK City of Culture"".
The Blade installation was seen by 1.1m people, of which 420,000 had touched or interacted with the artwork, the report suggests
Of the 1.1m people who saw the Blade installation in Queen Victoria Square, more than 420,000 people had interacted with it while half said the artwork was the main draw for their city centre visit, the report suggested.
It also said 38% of people who booked to see play The Hypocrite were new audience members at Hull Truck Theatre.
Mr Redmond said: ""These impressive figures indicate both value and the impact of being the UK City Culture, while vindicating the Panel's decision to award the title to Hull.
""They have done what we asked: raised the bar for whoever follows in 2021.""

Researchers also noted Hull Trains reporting a ""17% increase in passengers in January 2017"" in comparison to the same month last year.

"Jumbo says black UK stars win US roles because 'we are better'
English actress Cush Jumbo says British black actors are being given roles in America over their US counterparts because ""we are better"".
The Good Fight star said: ""The reason I'm doing so well is our training, our work ethic... we learn our lines.
""Why are we not trying to keep that here... and tell the whole world that we are the best rather than letting people slip through the net?""
Jumbo was speaking to a Labour Party inquiry into access and diversity.
She said she would love to find a job in Britain, but has had to take roles in the USA because there is more work on offer across the pond.
Cush Jumbo says she has missed out on roles because her skin colour
""I would like nothing more than to be working on television and in film in this country,"" said the 31-year-old.
Jumbo compared her experience with US drama The Good Fight and its predecessor The Good Wife with her role in ITV drama Vera.
She said she stuck out ""like a sore thumb"" on the set of Vera and added: ""I was the only person of colour.
""You take the cast picture at the end of the season and you look back at it and you're the one sticking out brown face in a group of people and it hurts.""
Jumbo said Britain was ""pulling the plug"" on its talent.
She told Labour MPs Gloria de Piero and Tracy Brabin: ""I didn't go to America, I didn't run to America, I didn't even ask for America, I just took a plane there and suddenly everyone was telling me you're so talented, would you like 52 jobs?""
The London-born actress said: ""I'm just going to go over to Amazon because they will (cast me in a lead role) and they pay for it. Then they offer you another one and another one and, because I write as well, there's opportunities to write there as well.
""And it becomes less and less attractive to come back because you're coming back to nothing.
She also said that students from diverse backgrounds were quitting drama school ""because of how they are being treated"".

"Theresa May: UK must deal with its debts
Theresa May is also expected to defend the UK's free market economy
Theresa May is set to restate her determination to be tough on public spending despite political pressure to ease up on austerity.
""Continuing to deal with our debts,"" is the way to strengthen the economy, the Prime Minister will insist on Thursday.
Her speech at the Bank of England is timed to mark 20 years of political independence for the central bank.
It comes a day after Labour leader
to ""repair the damage done by austerity"".
At the Labour party's annual conference, Mr Corbyn - who has consistently criticised the Conservative party's austerity programme - insisted the party's policies were ""what most people in our country actually want"".
However, Mrs May will say that such an approach could ultimately result in less money for public services:
""To abandon that balanced approach with unfunded borrowing and significantly higher levels of taxation would damage our economy, threaten jobs, and hurt working people.""
The Bank of England was given political independence on 6 May 1997
Mrs May is also expected to defend the UK's free market economy in the speech.
The Prime Minister's first job after graduating in 1977 was at the Bank of England, and she is set to talk about how the nature of central banking generally has changed over the past 30 years.
The Bank of England was given political independence on 6 May 1997 by then chancellor Gordon Brown just days after the new Labour government took office.
Prior to that interest rate decisions were taken by the chancellor, rather than by independent economists.
That meant that changes were often driven by politics, for example lowering interest rates after a budget to boost the economy, or raising them immediately after a general election.
The Bank has since gained further powers including financial stability and the regulation of financial firms, such as banks and insurers.
Current Bank governor Mark Carney will host a two-day conference on Thursday and Friday to mark the 20-year anniversary of its independence. Speakers will include Gordon Brown as well as his then adviser Ed Balls.
Other central bankers including European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, Federal Reserve vice chairman Stanley Fischer, as well as International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde are also due to attend.

"RBS agrees £3.65bn settlement over risky mortgages in US
Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a £3.65bn ($4.75bn) settlement for its role in the sale of risky mortgage products in the US before the financial crisis.
The settlement is with the US Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the secondary mortgage market.
A separate deal with the Department of Justice is expected later this year.
The boss of RBS said the fine was a ""stark"" reminder of what happened to the bank before the financial crisis.
RBS has set aside a total of £6.7bn ($8.6bn) as a provision for both fines.
The bank's chief executive Ross McEwan, said: ""Today's announcement is an important step forward in resolving one of the most significant legacy matters facing RBS.
""This settlement is a stark reminder of what happened to this bank before the financial crisis, and the heavy price paid for its pursuit of global ambitions.""
Analysis: Simon Jack, BBC Business Editor
Although the settlement is enormous - it is not unexpected and RBS had already set aside £6.7 billion to settle their final bill. This is not quite it.
A separate settlement with the Department of Justice is expected later this year which could match or exceed today's settlement.
RBS today topped up the kitty for penalty payments by another £151m which will hit this year's earnings.
Despite its core business producing reasonable profits, fines for historical conduct has meant RBS has lost money every year since a £45bn government bailout in 2008.
RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has said he is hopeful that by the end of this year, the legacy issues that have dogged this bank will be behind it and the government will be able to start selling chunks of the bank back to the private sector.
The shares are currently worth around half the price the government paid for them but Philip Hammond has indicated that the government may be prepared to start selling shares at a loss.
The government still owns 72% of RBS.
The fine is over RBS's role in the mis-selling of sub-prime mortgage products in the run up to the financial crisis.
Several other banks, including Deutsche Bank, have already settled with US regulators.

"China commits to Paris climate deal as Trump decision looms
Mr Li said fighting climate change was in China's own interest
China will honour its commitments on climate change, its premier has said, as the US appears poised to pull out of a key deal.
Speaking on a visit to Germany, Premier Li Keqiang said fighting climate change was in China's own interest.
China was counting on other countries to follow its example, Mr Li said.
US President Donald Trump is due to announce his decision on the 2015 Paris agreement later. Some reports in the US suggest he will withdraw.
""China will continue to implement the promises made in the Paris accord. But of course we also hope to do this with the co-operation of others,"" Mr Li said.

""It is obviously a very important decision as the United States is the biggest economy in the world,"" he told the BBC.
""But independently of the decision of the American government, it's important that all other governments stay the course.
""The Paris agreement is essential for our collective future and it's also important that American society - like all other societies, the business community - mobilise themselves in order to preserve the Paris agreement as a central piece to guarantee the future of our children and grandchildren.""

Chinese media are critical of Mr Trump's hint that the US will leave the Paris agreement.
Nationalist newspaper Global Times said it would ""set a bad example"", reveal the US as ""selfish and irresponsible"" and ""weaken US leadership"".
However, state TV channels played down the significance, with Shanghai-based Dragon TV saying Mr Trump ""absolutely wasn't speaking formally"".
Russia also said it would stick to its climate commitments, but said the Paris agreement would be affected by a US pullout.
""It goes without saying that the effectiveness of this convention is likely to be reduced without its key participants,"" a Kremlin spokesman said.
Matt McGrath explains why we should care about climate change
Meanwhile British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was ""anxious"" at the prospect of a US withdrawal but said he believed Mr Trump was ""genuinely thinking about the issue"".
Some of the biggest gains in tackling carbon emissions in the US had been made at state level rather than federal level, he added.
Mr Trump's refusal to commit to the Paris agreement caused frustration at a G7 meeting last week, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel describing the discussion as ""difficult, not to say dissatisfying"".
China overtook the US as the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in 2007.
Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture on the atmosphere.
The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions.
Keep global temperatures ""well below"" the level of 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C

"How department stores changed the way we shop
BBC World Service, 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy
""No, I'm just looking."" Words most of us have said when approached politely by a sales assistant while browsing in a shop. Most of us will not have then experienced the sales assistant snarling: ""Then 'op it, mate!""
Hearing those words in a London shop made quite an impression on Harry Gordon Selfridge.
The year was 1888, and the flamboyant American was touring the great department stores of Europe - in Vienna, Berlin, the famous Bon Marche in Paris and then Manchester and London - to see what tips he could pick up for his then-employer, Chicago's Marshall Field.
Field popularised the phrase ""the customer is always right"". Evidently, not yet the case in England.
Two decades later, Selfridge was back in London, opening his eponymous department store on Oxford Street - now a global destination for retail, then an unfashionable backwater, but handily near a station on a newly opened Tube line.
Selfridges - pictured on its opening day, 15 March 1909 - became renowned for sumptuous window displays
Selfridges caused a sensation, partly due to its sheer size: the retail space covered six acres (24,000 sq m).
Selfridge also installed the largest glass windows in the world - and created, behind them, the most sumptuous shop displays.
But more than scale, what set Selfridges apart was attitude.
Harry Gordon Selfridge introduced a whole new shopping experience, one honed in the department stores of late-19th Century America.
""Just looking"" was positively encouraged.
highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.
It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find
As he had in Chicago, Selfridge swept away the previous custom of stashing merchandise behind locked glass doors in cabinets, or high up on unreachable shelves.
Instead, he laid out the open aisle displays we now take for granted, where you can touch a product, pick it up, and inspect it from all angles, without a salesperson hovering by your side.
In the full-page newspaper adverts he took out when his store opened, Selfridge compared the ""pleasures of shopping"" to those of ""sightseeing"".
Harry Gordon Selfridge revolutionised the shopping experience
Shopping had long been bound up with social display.
The old arcades of the great European cities, displaying their fine cotton fashions - gorgeously lit with candles and mirrors - were places for the upper classes not only to see, but to be seen.
Selfridge had no truck with snobbery or exclusivity. His adverts pointedly welcomed the ""whole British public"": ""No cards of admission are required.""
'The bottom of the pyramid'
Management consultants nowadays talk about the fortune to be found at the ""bottom of the pyramid"" - Selfridge was way ahead of them. In his Chicago store, he appealed to the working classes by dreaming up the concept of the ""bargain basement"".
Selfridge did perhaps more than anyone to invent shopping as we know it. But the ideas were in the air.
Another trailblazer was an Irish immigrant named Alexander Turney Stewart. Stewart introduced New Yorkers to the shocking concept of not hassling customers the moment they walked through the door, a novel policy he called ""free entrance"".
Alexander T Stewart set his prices low, hoping to make profits from high volumes of sales
AT Stewart and Co was among the first stores to practise the now-ubiquitous ""clearance sale"", periodically moving on old stock at knockdown prices to make room for new.
Stewart also offered no-quibble refunds. He made customers pay in cash, or settle their bills quickly. Traditionally, shoppers had strung out their lines of credit for up to a year.
He also recognised that not everybody liked to haggle, with many welcoming the simplicity of being quoted a fair price, and being told to take it or leave it.
Stewart made this ""one-price"" approach work by accepting unusually low mark-ups. ""[I] put my goods on the market at the lowest price I can afford,"" he said, ""although I realise only a small profit on each sale, the enlarged area of business makes possible a large accumulation of capital"".
This idea wasn't totally unprecedented, but it was certainly considered radical.
The first salesman Stewart hired was appalled to discover he'd not be allowed to apply his finely tuned skill of sizing up the customer's apparent wealth and extracting as extravagant a price as possible. He resigned on the spot, telling the youthful Irish shopkeeper he'd be bankrupt within a month.
By the time Stewart died, over five decades later, he was one of the richest men in New York.
The great department stores became cathedrals of commerce. At Stewart's ""Marble Palace"", the shopkeeper boasted: ""You may gaze upon a million dollars' worth of goods, and no man will interrupt either your meditation or your admiration.""
They took shopping to another level, sometimes literally.
Corvin's in Budapest installed a lift that became such an attraction in its own right that they began to charge for using it. In London, Harrods's moving staircase carried 4,000 people an hour.
In such shops, one could buy anything from cradles to gravestones.
Golf champion John Henry Taylor instructing customers at Harrods in 1914
Harrods offered a full funeral service. There were picture galleries, smoking rooms, tea rooms, concerts. The shop displays bled out into the street, as entrepreneurs built covered galleries around their stores.
It was, says historian Frank Trentmann, the birth of ""total shopping"".
The glory days of the city centre department store have faded a little. With the rise of cars has come the out-of-town shopping mall, where land is cheaper.
Tourists in England still enjoy Harrods and Selfridges, but many also head to Bicester Village, a few miles north of Oxford, an outlet that specialises in luxury brands at a discount.
But the experience of going to the shops has changed remarkably little since pioneers such as Stewart and Selfridge turned it on its head. And it may be no coincidence that they did it at a time when women were gaining in social and economic power.
There are, of course, some tired stereotypes about women and their supposed love of shopping. But the evidence implies that the stereotypes aren't completely imaginary.
Time-use studies suggest women spend more time shopping than men.
Other research indicates that this is a matter of preference as well as duty: men tend to say they like shops with easy parking and short checkout queues. Women are more likely to prioritise different aspects of the shopping experience, such as the friendliness of sales assistants.
This wouldn't have shocked Harry Gordon Selfridge. He saw that female customers offered profitable opportunities that other retailers were bungling.
One quietly revolutionary move was that Selfridges featured a ladies' lavatory, a facility London's shopkeepers had hitherto neglected to provide.
He saw - as other men apparently had not - that women might want to stay in town all day, without having to use an insalubrious public convenience or retreat to a respectable hotel for tea whenever they wanted to relieve themselves.
Selfridges was designed to be as attractive as possible to women
Selfridge's biographer Lindy Woodhead even thinks he ""could justifiably claim to have helped emancipate women"". That's a big claim for a shopkeeper, but social progress can sometimes come from unexpected directions.
And Harry Gordon Selfridge certainly saw himself as a social reformer.
He once explained why, at his Chicago store, he'd introduced a creche. ""I came along just at the time when women wanted to step out on their own,"" he said.
""They came to the store and realised some of their dreams.""

In 1996, the Backstreet Boys released their debut album, ""Backstreet's Back."" ""Millennium,"" ""Black & Blue,"" ""Never Gone,"" ""Unbreakable"" and ""This Is Us"" followed. After parting with the group years ago, Kevin Richardson (second from left) rejoined A.J. McLean, Howie Dorough, Nick Carter and Brian Littrell. In March,
as well as a new album and tour. Here are some other boy bands to scream over.
As One Direction, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Harry Styles are heartthrobs -- not unlike the Rolling Stones were once upon a time,
. Malik announced in 2015 that he'd be leaving the group and the remaining members went on hiatus the following year to fans' dismay.
*NSYNC members Lance Bass, Chris Kirkpatrick, Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez and Joey Fatone struck gold in the United States with ""I Want You Back"" in 1998. Before they broke up in 2002, the group established a mega fan base with songs like ""No Strings Attached"" and ""Bye, Bye, Bye."" Although they're not together anymore, *NSYNC is as popular as ever; you should've heard the shrieking their reunion at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards caused.
Luke Hemmings, Michael Clifford, Calum Hood and Ashton Irwin met in the Western Sydney suburbs and played their first gig as 5 Seconds of Summer at a Sydney hotel in 2011. They grew their fan base by posting videos on YouTube, and soon enough, they were opening for One Direction. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2014 and debuted at No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard chart.
Though they never made it big in the U.S., boy band Westlife was a huge hit in their native Ireland. They'd sold more than 50 million copies of their albums worldwide by the time they disbanded in 2012.
Sometimes considered the original Irish boy band, Boyzone was founded in 1993 and won many BRIT and Europe Music Awards.
Danny Wood, Donnie Wahlberg, Jordan Knight, Joey McIntyre and Jonathan Knight of New Kids on the Block perform live in 2008. The group, which rose to superstardom in the late '80s and early '90s, reunited for 2008's ""The Block"" and 2011's ""NKOTBSB"" with the Backstreet Boys. The Kids released their box set ""10"" in 2013.
Ralph Tresvant, Michael Bivins, Ronnie DeVoe, Ricky Bell, Bobby Brown and Johnny Gill of New Edition perform an homage to Michael Jackson during the 2009 BET Awards. The R&B group's albums include 1983's ""Candy Girl"" and 1988's ""Heart Break,"" among others.
98 Degrees perform in 1999, made up of brothers Nick and Drew Lachey, Justin Jeffre and Jeff Timmons. The group released three albums, in addition to one Christmas album, between 1997 and 2000. Their latest album, ""2.0,"" arrived in 2013.
Isaac, Taylor and Zac Hanson of Hanson perform in 2001. The brothers became superstars with their 1997 album ""Middle of Nowhere"" thanks to a little earworm called ""MMMBop.""
The Wanted released their self-titled debut album in 2010, and by 2012 their song ""Glad You Came"" was inescapable. Jay McGuiness, Nathan Sykes, Max George, Siva Kaneswaran and Tom Parker, here after receiving a 2013 People's Choice award, are repped by Justin Bieber's manager Scooter Braun, so they know a thing or two about heartthrobbing. The group has appeared on TV in the E! reality show ""The Wanted Life,"" and their album ""Word of Mouth"" was released in September 2013.
Menudo performs in 2008. Originally formed in the '70s, they helped launch Ricky Martin's career. The boy band has had many members over the years.
The made-for-TV boy band 2gether debuted on MTV in 2000. Shown here at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards, the guys attracted attention with songs like ""U + Me = Us (Calculus)"" and ""Say It (Don't Spray It)."" ""2ge+her: The Series"" followed the original TV movie, but ended in 2001 when member Michael Cuccione died of cancer. In
, Alex Solowitz, Evan Farmer, Noah Bastian and Kevin Farley said they were looking to reunite the band.
The Boys released three albums between 1988 and 1992. ""Dial My Heart"" was the debut single from brothers Khiry, Hakim, Tajh and Bilal Abdulsamad.
Erik-Michael Estrada, Jacob Underwood, Trevor Penick, Dan Miller and Ashley Parker Angel of the group O-Town perform in 2002. The group, which came to be thanks to the first season of MTV's ""Making the Band,"" is perhaps best known for the single ""Liquid Dreams"" in 2000.
Lyte Funky Ones, also known as LFO, released their first album in 1999. Made up of Rich Cronin, Devin Lima and Brad Fischetti, the boy band referenced New Kids on the Block and gave a shout out to girls who wear Abercrombie & Fitch on their single ""Summer Girls.""
Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Michael Nesmith of The Monkees, the band created for the 1960s TV series of the same name, won the hearts of fans with hits like ""I'm a Believer,"" ""Pleasant Valley Sunday"" and ""Daydream Believer.""
Boy bands enjoy the height of fandom
Nick Carter of Backstreet Boys says there's something for everyone
Boy bands never go on to become man bands, or at least that's what Nick Carter believes.
As a member of the Backstreet Boys and one of the ""architects"" on ABC's reality series ""Boy Band,"" Carter should know.
The Backstreet Boys formed in 1993, but that might as well be yesterday as far as their devotees are concerned.
""I don't think you ever age out of being a boybander, and that's both the beauty of it and my gift,"" Carter told CNN. ""We get to have fun and always be boys. [Fans] still call us boys to this day.""
And boy, what a ton of die-hard fans there are.
Backstreet Boys talk life before Internet

What is it about boy bands that make them so appealing that grown women (and men) will show up at concerts shrieking like they're still tweens?
Here's why we think boy bands are -- and will always be -- a thing.
From the Beatles to One Direction, every generation seems to have that one group fans love to sigh over.
And while screenshots may have replaced posters on bedroom walls, young devotion remains the same or more heightened because social media now allows performers to interact directly with their followers.
There's something for everyone
If you are into the bad boy, the guy next door or the one who makes you laugh, boy bands offer someone to love.
And, of course, there is always that one who stands out from the others (looking at you, Justin Timberlake!)
""People love boy bands because you can relate to at least one member,"" Carter said.
""Boy bands give people the right to be able to choose who their favorites are and who they can relate to. Everyone can find someone that they can call their own,"" Carter added.
The thrill of the competition
Whether it be The Beatles vs. The Rollings Stones, Menudo vs. New Edition, Backstreet vs. N'Sync or One Direction vs. 5 Seconds of Summer, there are consistent competitions among fans as to THE boy band of the moment.
Sometimes there is also debate over which member of a particular band is the cutest, most talented or most likely to have a great solo career.
Even the boy band members are aware of it.
that of his fellow group members, Zayn Malik has the ""fantastic voice,"" Liam Payne has ""good stage presence,"" Nial Horan is ""fearless"" and Harry Styles ""comes across very cool.""
""And then there's me,"" Tomlinson said.
For older fans, boy bands offer a chance to relive days when homework, dating and making curfew were life's biggest concerns.
A really good song from a favorite band can transport anyone right back to that era, and the best songs are timeless.
Don't take our word for it. Check out what happened when New Edition performed at the BET Awards earlier this year.
The look, stage presence, dance moves, a voice, boy band members have to have it all -- and all together.
Carter said there's a particular chemistry boy bands have to have, and that's what he and fellow architects producer Timbaland and former Spice Girl Emma Bunton are looking for on ""Boy Band.""
""We are looking for people who want to be a part of something special when it comes to being part of a team or being part of a family of brotherhood,"" Carter said. ""If you put one bad apple in a bunch, it's going to spoil the whole batch.""

"Anti-Brexit bus 'banned' from parking in Oxford
The bus tour has been organised by the ""Is it worth it?"" campaign after a crowdfunding appeal
A council has been criticised for ""banning"" an anti-Brexit bus from stopping in a street in Oxford.
The ""Brexit Facts Bus"" started a tour of the UK earlier but has been told it cannot park in Broad Street when it comes to the city on Monday.
John Tanner, secretary of the Oxford European Association, called it an ""extraordinary"" attack on free speech.
But Oxfordshire County Council said it could not ""permit political advertising on the highway"".
The Conservative-controlled authority added the rules were the same whether they were ""signs or vehicles parked on the road for an event"" and applied to all councils under

Campaigners had wanted to park outside Balliol College in Oxford, which counts Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU - among its alumni.
The bus tour started with stops in London earlier and is visiting towns and cities across the UK until 28 February.
Phillip Richmond from the ""Is it worth it"" campaign, which organised the tour, said they had obtained permission where necessary.

"HBO social media hacked in latest cyber security breach
The hack is the latest to hit HBO and its titles, which include the popular fantasy drama Game of Thrones
HBO's Facebook and Twitter accounts have been compromised in the latest cyber security breach to hit the firm.
A group called OurMine appeared to take control of the main HBO accounts, as well as those for the network's shows including Game of Thrones.
One posts said ""OurMine are here. we are just testing your security"".
It is the latest cyber security headache for the entertainment firm after hackers released Game of Thrones scripts and company data.
Some of the social media posts were removed quickly afterwards.
HBO did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.
OurMine has a reputation for hacking high profile Twitter accounts.
, as well as Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales,
and Google chief executive Sundar Pichai.
The hack is the latest in a string of security setbacks for HBO in recent weeks.
Unidentified hackers claim to have stolen 1.5TB of data from the company in July.
Out of the haul they released Game of Thrones scripts, company documents and unbroadcast episodes of HBO's other shows including
for leaking an episode of Game of Thrones before it aired. The accused were current and former employees of a Mumbai-based company that stores and processes the series for an online streaming service.
Next came a leak in Europe. An episode of the fantasy show was
on to its broadcaster's Spanish and Nordic streaming platforms days before it was scheduled to be broadcast.
The episode, titled Death is the Enemy, has since been withdrawn, but not before it was copied and circulated on several file-sharing platforms.

"The Mexican doctor rehydrating the dead
In the 1990s, Ciudad Juarez became infamous for the number of women killed there
Warning: This article contains images that readers might find disturbing.
Rosa María Apodaca has spent the past six years looking for her eldest daughter.
Patricia Jazmín Ibarra was 18 when she left on the morning of 7 June 2011 to go to work at a mobile phone shop in the centre of Ciudad Juárez.
""They stole her,"" says her mother, who has given up her job to look for Patricia Jazmín.
Ms Apodaca knows that many of the young girls who disappeared from Ciudad Juárez were eventually found dead.
The city on the Mexican-US border is located on a key route for drug smuggling and human trafficking.
In the 1990s, Ciudad Juárez became infamous for the staggering numbers of young women who disappeared from it, and between 2008 and 2011 the city held the dubious title of murder capital of the world.
""They never find them alive. They find only bones, this is how they give them back to their families,"" Ms Apodaca says of the many women who have gone missing.
""You never have the certainty that it is your own daughter.""
It is people like Ms Apodaca that Dr Alejandro Hernández Cárdenas is trying to help.
He works as a forensic doctor at the prosecutor's office and has developed a special technique to rehydrate corpses in order to help identify them.
Dr Alejandro Hernández Cárdenas has invented a formula for the rehydration of bodies
The technique is so innovative that last year the Mexican Institute for Industrial Property gave him a patent for his secret formula.
Forensic experts have used glycerine injections to reconstitute fingers to get prints for over a century. But that technique does not work for entire bodies.
If the bodies can be rehydrated enough to allow for fingerprinting, identification becomes easier
DNA testing can help, but in order to identify bodies, samples from two direct family members are needed for comparison.
With the rehydration process, the body can regain most of its original condition so families can identify it.
""I think I am doing this work because I was affected by the idea of these bodies going to mass graves or their families not being able to mourn properly,"" Dr Hernández says.
The rehydration technique has also helped provide key leads in criminal investigations.
When Dr Hernández rehydrated a corpse in the state of Queretaro, in central Mexico, he discovered unusual lesions on its skin, which later led to an arrest being made.
Rehydration sometimes reveals tattoos or other unique characteristics
The doctor was told that his help was key in bringing the murderer to justice.
Dr Hernández, 59, says that he first thought of becoming a forensic expert when he was 18 and studying to be a dentist while also driving an ambulance to help provide for his young family.
One night in 1977, he was called out to a train accident that had killed 35 people and had left most of the victims unrecognisable.
""When the forensic doctor arrived, he told us to check their teeth,"" Dr Hernández recalls.
He helped out at the morgue for four or five days, while the victims' families were waiting for news outside.
While the task may seem gruesome to some, it inspired in Dr Hernández a desire to help identify victims of crime.
Pig skin and human fingers
After becoming a dentist and eventually joining the forensic lab, he started experimenting with his rehydration technique.
Dr Hernández has made it his mission to try and identify bodies which otherwise may end up in mass graves without a name
He often has little to go on, such as a piece of desiccated skin
He used pig skin and human fingers he kept in glass jars and checked on them daily.
One day in 2004 he was inspecting seven jars. When he took out the finger from the fourth jar, it looked perfect.
""It was like a new finger. I couldn't believe it,"" he says.
At first he thought it was too good to be true and suspected his colleagues of playing a trick on him. But when he confronted them, one told him: ""We don't mess with them, they smell too bad.""
He had found the magic formula and four years later managed to rehydrate a full corpse.
In recent years, Dr Hernández has been applying his technique more and more to migrants found dead in the border area.
Posters of missing people are a common sight in Ciudad Juárez
Ciudad Juárez is one of the main crossing points to the US. More than 6,000 bodies have been recovered from along the border since the 1990s.
The bodies are often found in mass graves and are often hard to identify because they have been mutilated or are mummified because of the harsh weather conditions.
Because there is no investigation unit at the forensic lab where he works, Dr Hernández has been financing his research himself, paying for the chemicals and working on it in his spare time.
He hopes that someone will take an interest in his research but ultimately wishes for less, rather than more, work. ""It's not that I am lazy, it's just that when I have a lot of work it means that a lot of people have died,"" he explains.
""I would prefer not to have found this formula - if it meant that those people had never died.""

"UK PM seeks 'safe and ethical' artificial intelligence
Theresa May will say that harnessing AI poses a major test of leadership
The prime minister is to say she wants the UK to lead the world in deciding how artificial intelligence can be deployed in a safe and ethical manner.
Theresa May will say at the World Economic Forum in Davos that a new advisory body,
, will co-ordinate efforts with other countries.
In addition, she will confirm that the UK will join the Davos forum's own council on artificial intelligence.
But others may have stronger claims.
Earlier this week, Google picked France as the base for a

Facebook also announced it was doubling the size of its existing AI lab in Paris, while software firm SAP committed itself to a 2bn euro ($2.5bn; Â£1.7bn) investment into the country that will include work on machine learning.
Meanwhile, a report released last month by the Eurasia Group consultancy suggested that the
in a ""two-way race for AI dominance"".
It predicted Beijing would take the lead thanks to the ""insurmountable"" advantage of offering its companies more flexibility in how they use data about its citizens.
Theresa May is expected to meet US President Donald Trump at the Davos event on Thursday.
The prime minister will base the UK's claim to leadership in part on the health of its start-up economy, quoting a figure that a new AI-related company has been created in the country every week for the last three years.
In addition, she is expected to say that the UK is recognised as first in the world for its preparedness to ""bring artificial intelligence into government"".
DeepMind's game-playing AI experiments are among the UK's highest profile success stories
However, she will recognise that many people have concerns about potential job losses and other impacts of the tech, and declare that AI poses one of the ""greatest tests of leadership for our time"".
""But it is a test that I am confident we can meet,"" she will add.
""For right across the long sweep of history from the invention of electricity to advent of factory production, time and again initially disquieting innovations have delivered previously unthinkable advances and we have found the way to make those changes work for all our people,"" Mrs May will say.
This includes through a new UK advisory body, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation.
Academics and tech industry leaders differ in opinion about the risks involved.
At one end of the scale, Prof Stephen Hawking has
""spell the end of the human race"", while Tesla's Elon Musk has said that a universal basic income - in which people get paid whether or not they work - has a ""good chance"" of becoming necessary as jobs become increasingly automated.
Facebook's AI chief has played down the risk of robots destroying humanity
But Facebook's AI chief Yann LeCun has said society will develop the ""checks and balances"" to prevent a Terminator movie-like
told the BBC he did not believe predictions of mass job losses would occur.
""There will be some jobs eliminated but the vast majority will be augmented,"" he explained.
""You're going to have more doctors not fewer. More lawyers not fewer. More teachers not fewer.
""But they are going to be more efficient.""
Eric Schmidt thinks AI will enhance jobs rather than destroy them en masse
While many tech industry leaders acknowledge there will be a need for new rules and regulations, they also suggest it may be premature to introduce them in the short term.
Microsoft, for example, has launched a book called
to coincide with the Davos event.
to govern its own AI work internally before legislation is passed.
Much of the AI research involved in developing Amazon's Alexa voice assistant was done in the UK
By Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondent
Is the UK really on track to lead the world in Artificial Intelligence?
Well the United States and China might have a thing or two to say about that.
Both are engaged in an AI arms race and are investing the kind of sums that would make Chancellor Philip Hammond's - or even Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's - eyes water.
Still, it is true that in London and Cambridge some of the world's leading AI scientists are at work. It was here that the Alexa digital voice assistant was developed and where a computer was trained to defeat champion players of the Chinese game of Go.
The trouble is that those scientists were employed by Amazon and by Google, which brought up the DeepMind AI business when it was still in its infancy.
That's a pattern frequently repeated in the UK technology sector. A Chinese AI investor on a trip to the UK this week expressed surprise that the government had not done more to protect these AI assets.
Now there is to be another AI body, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, joining in a global conversation about the moral challenges posed by AI.
We already have the Alan Turing Institute which has a similar mission.
The concern is that while the UK agonises over the implications of this technology, the Chinese will just be getting on with it.
Theresa May also intends to address the need for tech firms to tackle terrorism and extremist content during her speech.
The Prime Minister is expected to single out Telegram by name
She intends to state that Telegram - a privacy-focused chat app - became popular with criminals and terrorists over a short period of time.
""We need to see more co-operation from smaller platforms like this,"" she will add.
and blocked channels used by extremists.
In addition, the prime minister will call on tech company investors to play their part by demanding that trust and safety issues be considered.

"Facebook's news trust survey comprises just two questions
Facebook says the survey has been posed only to US-based members to date
A survey used by Facebook to determine how much prominence to give to different news publishers consists of just two brief questions.
The first asks whether a user recognises the websites displayed.
The second asks whether the user trusts them on a five-point scale ranging from ""not at all"" to ""entirely"".
Some journalists have complained that the questions over-simplify matters, but the social network has said it will combine the results with other data.
""Trust is one among many signals,""
""[It] only applies for publishers for which we have enough data, so it doesn't yet [affect] most publishers.
""I understand that some people may baulk at how simple a survey is, but complicated surveys can be confusing and bias-signal, and meaningful patterns can emerge from broad surveys,""
Facebook's head of news feed, Adam Mosseri, defended the simplicity of the survey
He acknowledged, however, that the social network should have ""done a better job"" explaining its plans
that it was to start prioritising articles from publications that a sample of US-based users had rated trustworthy.
Facebook's move is part of a wider effort to address complaints about so-called ""fake news"" and propaganda being spread on its platform.
, the social network faced a fresh backlash.
""Hard to view Facebook news survey as anything other than yet another attempt to shirk responsibility for the integrity of its service,"" tweeted Chris Williams, deputy
: ""I've filled more robust surveys at fast food restaurants.""
""This is kind of like a brand awareness survey... trust in news is much more complicated. How well-sourced is the article? Are other sites verifying it? Is it news or analysis?""
But others have been more forgiving.
The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism asks its own trust-focused questions as part of an annual review into the digital news industry.
The report's author said there was a risk that the new survey might simply encourage Facebook to favour long-established brands at the cost of their digital-born rivals, but he added that he expected the outcome to be more nuanced.
""The power of the survey is not the two questions, but how Facebook can combine the answers with the other information it already has,"" Nic Newman told the BBC.
""Like what news sources you use, what interests you have in politics - all these things will produce a huge amount of very rich data about trust in different contexts.
""But we need more transparency from Facebook about how it plans to use the data because there will be consequences to whatever decisions it takes.""

"Welsh Assembly expansion plans put to public consultation
Sixty members is no longer enough to deliver for the people of Wales, an expert panel's report said
People are being asked to share their view on plans to expand the Welsh Assembly by an extra 20 to 30 members.
An expert panel said the move was necessary to cope with the growing workload as more power is devolved.
Also, the vote would be given to 16 and 17-year-olds as part of proposals to reform the 60-member assembly.
Presiding Officer Elin Jones hailed ""the opportunity to forge the national parliament that the people of Wales deserve to champion their interests"".
The assembly is already due to be renamed the Welsh Parliament as a result of a previous consultation.
Powers for the assembly to change its electoral rules, size and other internal affairs are being granted under the 2017 Wales Act.
Last week, AMs voted in favour of putting the expert panel's recommendations out to public consultation.
Elin Jones said it was an opportunity to forge a ""national parliament that the people of Wales deserve""
Ms Jones said: ""The Wales Act 2017 marks the start of a new phase of devolution in Wales, giving us the opportunity to make profound changes to our legislature.
""We now have the opportunity to forge the national parliament that the people of Wales deserve to champion their interests.""
The panel, chaired by Prof Laura McAllister of Cardiff University, also recommended a change in the voting system, to a proportional method called the Single Transferable Vote.
One option would be to pair the current 40 constituencies to merge them into 20 seats, each with four AMs, giving a total of 80.
A gender quota would boost the number of women in the Senedd, and the option of standing as a ""job share"" candidate would aim to encourage people with disabilities or caring responsibilities.
Any changes will require a law to be passed in the assembly with a two-thirds majority.
When the report was published in December, Welsh Labour said it would not give its view until its 2019 conference, which Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas said ""kills dead"" any chance of reform before the next election in 2021.
In January, the Welsh Government proposed

"UK wealth gap 'widening since mid-2000s' says report
The UK's wealth gap has been widening since the mid-2000s, a report says.
Think tank the Resolution Foundation estimates that 1% of the population owns 14% of the nation's assets - worth about £11 trillion.
At the other end of the financial scale, 15% either own no assets at all, or are in debt.
The government has responded to the findings by insisting that income inequality is at its lowest level since the mid-1980s.
The Resolution Foundation says it is non-partisan and was founded in 2005, with ""the goal of improving living standards for the 15 million people in Britain on low and middle incomes"".
The foundation says the spreading of property wealth in the mid-1990s and mid-2000s fuelled a decade-long fall in wealth inequality - but that progress has since gone into reverse.
The proportion of property wealth owned by the bottom four-fifths of adults grew from 35% in 1995 to 40% in 2005.
However, the foundation warns ""that with home ownership steadily falling since its mid-2000s peak, the proportion of property wealth owned by the bottom four-fifths of the population has started to fall again"".
""Given the hugely unequal distribution of wealth across Britain, it's time we looked into how the nation's wealth is divided up and what the consequences are for those who never build up assets of any significance,"" said Conor D'Arcy, policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation.
""Falling levels of home ownership mean that, having once been a great force in driving down inequality, shifts in who owns what property are now fuelling the wealth gap between rich and poor, while also creating sharp wealth divides between young and old.""
A government spokesperson said: ""We want to build an economy that works for everyone.
""Income inequality is now at its lowest level since the mid-1980s and the lowest paid saw their wages grow faster than for 20 years.
""The next step is to get Britain building more homes and halt the decline in housing affordability.
""The Housing White Paper which sets out a bold package of reforms, following a £7.2bn investment at Autumn Statement, will help ensure more working people have the security of a decent place to live.""

"Theresa May and ministers gather for key Brexit meeting
Theresa May is to chair the first of two key Brexit meetings with her senior ministers as the government faces more calls to clarify the UK's position.
The Brexit cabinet committee is to sketch out what the future relationship between the UK and EU might look like.
It will focus on Northern Ireland and immigration, and on trade on Thursday.
to the single market if there is a dispute after Brexit.
Meanwhile, businesses are warning that ""patience is wearing thin"" with ""continued division"".
The EU's chief negotiator said this week there is ""not a moment to lose"" in finding a deal.
Negotiations are already taking place ahead of the UK's scheduled departure from the European Union in March 2019.
But there are believed to be divisions within the cabinet on how closely bound the UK and EU will be in years to come.
The tensions within the Conservative Party were underlined on Monday when pro-EU former minister Anna Soubry told the BBC Mrs May should ""sling out"" arch Brexiteers, and threatened to quit the party.
Barnier: It's time for UK to make a choice
Eurosceptics have been calling for a ""clean"" separation with the EU so the UK has the freedom to strike new trade deals, while pro-EU MPs say the UK should retain the closest possible access to the single market.
The government says it wants a ""bespoke"" deal, maintaining ""frictionless"" trade, avoiding a hard border with Ireland and securing the power to strike free deals with other countries.
The 11-member European Union Exit and Trade (Strategy and Negotiations) sub-committee is a key part of the government's decision-making process.
Its members include Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who were at the forefront of the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, and Chancellor Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who campaigned for Remain.
Among those calling for more clarity on the UK's position is the British Chambers of Commerce, which has written to Mrs May asking for a ""clear, unequivocal statement of intent"".
""The perception amongst businesses on the ground, large and small alike, is one of continued division,"" it said.
""Even amongst the many optimistic, future-oriented firms - those who see opportunity in change - patience is wearing thin.
""Directly affected companies are poised to activate contingency plans. Many others, worryingly, have simply disengaged.
""Clear UK negotiating objectives are crucial to both business and public confidence.""
The government said Mrs May had set out a ""clear ambition for a deep and special partnership with the European Union"" and was confident a temporary implementation period, planned for immediately after the UK leaves, would provide businesses with certainty.

"Wrong time for interest rate rise, Cunliffe warns
Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe has joined the debate over raising UK interest rates, indicating now is not the right time for a rise.
Governor Mark Carney has also said this is not the time for a rate adjustment.
has said he may join rate rise dissenters and back a hike later in the year.
Sir Jon told the BBC he wanted to see how inflation pressures evolved before deciding to raise interest rates from a record low 0.25%.
He also wanted to watch and see if improvements in business investment and exports could compensate for a consumer slowdown.
At its last rate rise meetings, three out of eight members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) surprisingly voted to raise interest rates, jolting financial markets.
The 5-3 vote by the Bank's policymakers was the closest for a rate rise since 2007, and came with inflation close to a four-year high of 2.9%.
Inflation is now well above the Bank's target rate of 2%.
He told BBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money that consumer spending ""is slowing as households' real incomes are squeezed by higher inflation, we expect some of that slowing to be offset by growth in business investment, growth in exports. And I want to see how that plays out.""
Sir Jon added: ""We do have to look at what's happening to domestic inflation pressure, and I think that, on the data we have at the moment, gives us a bit of time to see how this evolves.""
The Bank said earlier this month inflation was likely to exceed 3% this autumn.
Inflation overshooting the BoE's target was ""not a comfortable place"" for any member of the MPC, Sir Jon said.
However, he added that it was important to consider how much of the overshoot was generated domestically, and how much was a product of the fall in the strength of the pound, which makes imports more expensive.
The Bank deputy governor also pointed out that average earnings excluding bonuses rose at an annual rate of just 1.7% in the three months to April, the weakest increase since January 2015.

"Holly Willoughby reveals 'negative comments' over appearance in early career
This Morning host Holly Willoughby has revealed she faced ""negative comments"" early in her career due to ""judgement"" about her appearance.
""I think when I started out... a lot of people look at the blonde hair and this and that and the other, and have a massive judgement on you,"" she said.
She told ITV's Jonathan Ross show: ""I think I have it less now.
""I couldn't be anyone else and actually the bits where I mess up or I'm just me seem to be the things that work.""
She presented shows including Xchange on CBBC in 2003
The This Morning hosts are known for being firm friends as well as colleagues
Willoughby, who co-presents ITV's This Morning and Dancing on Ice with Phillip Schofield and appears on ITV2's Celebrity Juice, said the volume of her TV work meant ""you can only be you"".
""When you accept that, then that just makes things easier.""
She also spoke of her friendship with Schofield, whose early career began on BBC children's television, as a continuity announcer in the BBC One ""broom cupboard"".
""I love that man. We met on Dancing on Ice, rink side would you believe?
'Keith is really annoying'
""I'd obviously watched him on the telly lots, he was in the broom cupboard, he was my children's TV presenter that I used to watch. I was a bit scared when I first met him but that changed very quickly when I realised he was basically me in the male form.""
The pair are famous for ""corpsing"" on live TV - frequently creasing up with laughter while trying to maintain a straight face for the cameras.
Willoughby was slightly less complimentary about Keith Lemon, who hosts Celebrity Juice.
""Keith is really annoying but you could have guessed that right? He's like my naughty older brother who flirts with me occasionally,"" she told Ross, whose show will be broadcast on ITV on 30 September.

"Oscar Pistorius murder sentence increased to 13 years
Updated 0825 GMT (1625 HKT) November 24, 2017
Oscar Pistorius sentenced to 6 years in prison
Oscar Pistorius sentenced to 6 years in prison
A high court in South Africa increased Oscar Pistorius' prison sentence Friday to 13 years and five months for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal issued the ruling after the prosecution appealed his previous sentence of six years as too lenient.
The former Olympic and Paralympic sprinter killed
at his home in an upscale Pretoria neighborhood in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 -- an act he says was an accident after he mistook her for an intruder. The prosecution called it a deliberate act after the two had an argument.
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has argued that Pistorius' sentence was ""shockingly lenient"" while the defense has said the appeal for a higher sentence should be dismissed.
Oscar Pistorius, as he leaves the High Court in Pretoria on July 6.
Pistorius was initially convicted of manslaughter in 2014 after months of hearings, but a higher court changed that to murder last year.
The judge surprised many when she sentenced Pistorius to six years. The minimum sentence for murder in South Africa is 15 years, but individual judges can lower the sentence if there are ""substantial and compelling"" reasons to do so.
During Pistorius' initial sentencing, the judge cited mitigating circumstances for the lesser punishment, saying Pistorius was genuinely remorseful and a good candidate for rehabilitation.
She described him as a ""fallen hero"" who will never be at peace.

Sam Shepard in a stare in a scene from the film 'Black Hawk Down', 2001.
Sam Shepard, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and Oscar-nominated actor, died on Thursday at his home in Kentucky. He was 73.

"Iconic NME magazine to end its weekly print edition
NME will no longer be available as a weekly magazine, its publisher has announced.
The final edition will be released on Friday after 66 years as one of the UK's most iconic music publications.
Its publisher Time Inc UK said the decision to stop its print edition is due to rising production costs and a ""tough"" advertising market.
Instead, it will be ""focusing investment on further expanding NME's digital audience"".
The magazine launched in 1952 and has featured global superstars on the front including David Bowie, Oasis, Dua Lipa, Amy Winehouse and Sam Smith.
Its website launched in 1997 and the magazine went free in September 2015.
Musicians and fans have been reacting to the news on social media.

"NHS Digital approves data off-shoring in new guidance
NHS Digital has said that individual care providers can choose to use public cloud services to store patient data.
, health data can be hosted offshore within the European Economic Area (EEA) or with certain US organisations.
The benefits include reduced costs and more flexible data sharing,
But the digital rights organisation Open Rights Group says allowing offshore data hosting is ""dangerous"".
NHS Digital has included a four-step guide to migrating to cloud services, which covers risk assessments and choosing data hosting locations.
The guidance says that implementing data protection is ""legally complex"".
A cloud service's technical and support staff may be based in a different country from where the data is hosted but still have access to patient information.
In the US, only organisations that are part of the
in partnership with the EU can safely host patient data, according to the report.
The Privacy Shield allows individual companies to comply with EU data protection requirements despite not being based in one of the 28 member states.
The European Commission can also approve countries not listed in the guidance for data hosting, according to the guidance.
Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group, said that the Privacy Shield scheme was ""highly open to legal challenge"".
""This is a dangerous move that could open up patient data for surveillance purposes, and that could have ramifications for patient health.""
""People might avoid getting care, which would obviously be very bad. Patient confidentiality has to come first.""

"Steinhoff facing credit squeeze
Retail group Steinhoff has said its lenders are starting to withdraw or suspend credit following allegations of accounting irregularities.
In a presentation to investors in London, the retailer added it was unable to say when the extent of alleged irregularities would be known.
Steinhoff said forecasts for each of its companies were ""evolving daily"".
It owns 6,500 outlets in 30 countries, including the UK's Poundland and furniture chains Bensons and Harveys.
A spokesperson for Poundland said ""nothing has changed"" for the company, and that Steinhoff are ""investors, not day-to-day managers"" of the business.
No-one was immediately available for comment at Bensons or Harveys.
""It's very difficult to see a company like this actually getting to a value of zero,"" Themba Gamedze told the BBC.
Mr Gamedze is a board member of the South African government employees' pension fund, Steinhoff's second-largest shareholder.
""But I think we are going to have to cut all the way back and perhaps re-consolidate around South Africa again,"" he adds.
""The board, for example, is predominantly South African and predominantly Afrikaans white male from Stellenbosch. So that is their comfort zone and think that they simply bit off more than they could chew.""
Shares in Steinhoff have collapsed since it said earlier this month that it would launch an inquiry into accounting irregularities, while top executives have resigned.
The South African firm is currently under investigation by German authorities for accounting fraud dating back to 2015.
On Tuesday morning, a former business partner, Andreas Seifert, said he would be taking legal action against the company in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands.
Steinhoff has announced several changes to its board, including the appointment of Daniel van der Merwe as its new chief executive.
The firm owes creditors more than $20bn (£15bn). Several global banks and private investors are facing the prospect of substantial losses.

Netflix sends message to Disney, rivals with Ryan Murphy deal
February 14, 2018: 12:22 PM ET
Shonda Rhimes is a Hollywood powerhouse
If Netflix's exclusive deal with producer Shonda Rhimes was a brush-back pitch to the traditional TV business -- and Disney in particular -- the streaming service's latest mega-signing, with Ryan Murphy, represents a bean ball.
Murphy, the producer of such shows as ""American Horror Story"" and ""Glee,"" is currently under the umbrella of 20th Century Fox Television, an entity that Disney intends to acquire in its
of key Fox assets. Part of the rationale for that merger was to bulk up the studio's content business as it prepares to launch its own streaming service, taking on Netflix's dominance as a direct pipeline into homes.
Netflix, however, is serving notice that it won't easily be trumped in the battle for premium content. And while the
ith Murphy is more than merely symbolic -- securing the services of a proven hit-maker -- there's no doubt that part of its appeal stems from sending a message to the talent community, especially after Murphy publicly stated that Disney CEO Bob Iger personally called to reassure and woo him.
Of course, there are plenty of variables built into this particular high-stakes chess match. Disney, for starters, possesses an enviable treasure trove of standout properties -- including its beloved animated titles, Marvel and Lucasfilm -- to use as the foundation of its service, having already announced that a ""Star Wars""-branded series will be part of the mix.
Netflix, moreover, is gambling that Murphy will be able to create new hits and buzz-worthy programming, which is never a sure thing, even for somebody with an enviable track record.
Related: Ryan Murphy is heading to Netflix
If there's a short-term winner in all this, it's clearly A-list talent and their representatives, who love nothing more than seeing bidding wars develop as new money comes into the business. Beyond Disney, Netflix also has its eyes trained on other deep-pocketed streaming competitors -- some still just getting their feet wet -- including Amazon, Apple and Google.
After the Rhimes deal was announced, her agent, ICM Partners managing partner Chris Silbermann, used a sports analogy to describe the underlying factors that motivated Netflix to sign the creator of ""Scandal"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" away from ABC Studios.
""The value of elite series creators has increased, in much the same way a franchise player drives the value of an NBA team,"" he
Money also isn't the only factor. Indeed, for top talent, the ability to work in a hands-off environment -- with near-total creative freedom, and diminished ratings pressure -- can be as much of a lure as cash.
Because these high-profile agreements will take considerable time before they bear fruit -- or not -- it will quite a while before analysts can properly evaluate how well these strategic maneuvers pan out.
Like kids on a sandlot, in fact, the game has really just started, with the big difference being that TV's rich are likely to get even richer while the sides choose their teams.

"Government urged to act over computer science GCSEs
The lack of skilled teachers is the biggest problem, the report found
More than half of England's secondary schools, 54%, did not offer GCSE computer science in 2015-16, a report from the Royal Society has found.
It urged the government to increase spending on computer education tenfold over the next five years to ensure youngsters can ""unlock the full potential of new technologies"".
The biggest issue was the lack of skilled teachers, the report found.
The Department for Education said more pupils were choosing the subject.
""We want to ensure our future workforce has the skills we need to drive the future productivity and economy of this country and that is why the government made computing a compulsory part of the national curriculum,"" said a spokesperson.
""Computer science GCSE entries continue to rise more quickly than any other subject.
""We recently saw an increase in entries to Stem subjects [science, technology, engineering and maths] for the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) and the number of girls taking Stem subjects at A-levels has increased by over 17% since 2010.
""Since 2012, the department has pledged £5m to the Network of Teaching Excellence in Computer Science programme, which has built a national network of nearly 400 computer science specialists (who) schools can commission to provide bespoke training for their teachers.""
Computer science in numbers
The number of schools not offering the subject at GCSE represented 30% of the total number of pupils in England
Across the UK, the report found that that only 11% of students in England took GCSE computer science
In 2017 only 20% of GCSE candidates in the subject were female and the figure fell to 10% at A-level
Bournemouth had the highest percentage of pupils (23%) opting to take computer science
Hartlepool, Harrow and Bracknell Forest had the highest proportion of school offering the subject at GCSE level, not including the Isles of Scilly which has a 100% rate as it teaches it at its only school
Two in three schools near the UK's technology hub in East London, did not offer it to pupils as a GSCE option
Other London boroughs, including Islington, Kensington & Chelsea, Tower Hamlets and the City of London also had a low proportion of schools offering the subject
The Royal Society, the UK's independent scientific academy, is concerned about how the lack of computing expertise will affect the future workforce.
Prof Steve Furber, who worked on the report, said: ""Computing teachers have told us that they feel the government rushed in a new curriculum without giving them the support or money to deliver it.
""The report paints a bleak picture in England, which meets only 68% of its computing teacher recruitment targets and where, as a result, one in two schools don't offer computer science at GCSE, a crucial stage of young people's education.""
He added that, ""overhauling the fragile state of our computing education"" would require an ambitious, multipronged approach.
The Royal Society called for:
A £60m investment in computer education over the next five years
The training of 8,000 secondary school computing teachers
by Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC News technology correspondent
This report highlights what some teachers have been telling me for a while - that the revolution in computing education in the UK has stalled.
Five years ago a head of steam built up behind the idea that children needed to be taught coding and that the ICT GCSE was not fit for purpose, teaching little more than how to use Microsoft Office.
The government responded by taking ICT off the National Curriculum and replacing it with computer science.
But this course is proving far more demanding of both pupils and teachers, and many schools have decided that it is just not worth the bother at a time when resources are tight.
Some ICT teachers who had always argued that it was a practical course, attractive to a far wider range of children, are now saying ""I told you so"".
But across the world of computing education there's agreement on one thing - more money needs to be spent on training teachers in this vital subject.
Prof Furber's views were echoed by technology firms Microsoft and Google, who are both working to increase computer skills among schoolchildren.
Google's UK managing director Ronan Harris said: ""There is still much more to do to ensure young people across the UK have access to computer science education.
""Whatever school they attend or whatever field they plan to go into, every student should have the opportunity to understand the principles and practices of computing.""
And Microsoft's UK chief executive Cindy Rose said: ""The risk, if we don't make these investments now, is that too many young people struggle to access new opportunities and the UK loses its advantage in a world being transformed by technology.""

What's happening in sport? Five things to know
Updated 1729 GMT (0129 HKT) January 23, 2018
There's a Brit in the final four of a grand slam ... and his name isn't Andy Murray.
Kyle Edmund, 23, secured the win of his career Tuesday, beating world No. 3 Grigor Dimitrov in four sets to reach the Australian Open semifinals.
Edmund's previous best result in a grand slam came when he reached the fourth round of the US Open in 2016, and his performance in Melbourne guarantees him a place inside the world's top 30 for the first time.
The current world No. 49, Edmund is the first Brit other than Murray to reach the semifinals of a major since Tim Henman at the 2004 US Open.
""I am loving it right now, just the way I'm playing,"" Edmund told reporters. ""I'm 23 years old, my first grand slam semifinal.
""First time I played on one of the biggest courts in the world, to beat a quality of player like Grigor. Of course, all these things I'm aware of.
""They're great feelings. You obviously don't play in the semifinals of a grand slam every day, or a quarters like today.""

Dimitrov: ATP win 'means a lot' for Bulgaria
Tuesday was a day for upsets at the Australian Open, as No. 1 seed Rafael Nadal exited the quarterfinals at the hands of Marin Cilic.
Leading by two sets to one after an epic tie break in the third, the Spaniard pulled up with what looked like a muscle injury in his upper leg.
Following a lengthy medical timeout, in which he received court side treatment, Nadal reentered the match a break down in the fourth.
Looking to keep the match competitive and break back, Nadal winced and grimaced after every sprint and sharp turn, while visibly limping in between points.
""In this tournament [it's] already happened a couple of times in my life, so it's really I don't want to say frustration, but is really tough to accept,"" Nadal, who looked noticeably upset, told reporters.
""We worked as much as we could to be ready. We think we were ready. At least we were in quarterfinals only losing a set. Preparation went quite good. I was playing good tennis. I was fighting for a grand slam.""

After what feels like an eternity, the longest-running transfer saga has come to an end.
Most people knew of Alexis Sanchez's skills on the pitch, but Manchester United's promotion of the transfer revealed to some a previously hidden talent: The Chilean knows his way around a piano!
Playing one of his new club's most evocative songs -- ""Glory Glory Man United"" --Sanchez showed he is almost as adept at tickling the ivories as he is at putting the ball in the back of the net.
ðŸŽ¹ Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats. Introducing
— Manchester United (@ManUtd)
It's not the first time Sanchez has showed off his musical talents; in 2014, German forward Lukas Podolski posted a video of Alexis serenading him with Richard Marx's hit ""Right Here Waiting.'
Hidden talents aside, United manager Jose Mourinho is delighted to have secured the signing of ""one of the best attacking players in the world.""
""He will bring his ambition, drive and personality, qualities that make a Manchester United player and a player that makes the team stronger and the supporters proud of their club dimension and prestige,"" added the United manager.

After 25 years of worsening eyesight, Mario Tobia eventually lost his vision to the degenerative disease Retinitis pigmentosa.
A talented golfer before losing his sight, Tobia feared he would never play the sport he loved again.
""When I first lost my vision it was pretty traumatic,"" Tobia tells CNN Sport. ""I had to stop working and things like that.
""Now I actually tell people that golf saved my life.""
Remarkably, Tobia regularly drives the ball over 240 yards -- just 50 yards shorter than the PGA Tour average.
It's the job of his coach, Frank Hesson, to set the club behind the ball, describe the lie and the conditions and whether he needs to open or close the face of the club.
Then Tobia takes a shot ""just like everybody else.""
""Some of the other players and other coaches look at us with their mouths wide open, but it's just something that he and I do together and both enjoy doing.""

"Max Clifford dies in hospital aged 74
Max Clifford had been serving an eight-year jail sentence for sex offences
Disgraced celebrity publicist Max Clifford has died in hospital, aged 74, after collapsing in prison.
Clifford collapsed in his cell at Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire on Thursday and again on Friday, his daughter said. He was taken to hospital where he suffered a cardiac arrest.
He had been serving an eight-year sentence for historical sex offences.
The Ministry of Justice said as with all deaths in custody, there would an investigation by the ombudsman.
A spokeswoman added: ""Our condolences are with Mr Clifford's family at this difficult time.""
His daughter Louise, 46, had
that Clifford first collapsed in his cell on Thursday when he was trying to clean it, adding: ""It was just too much.""
She said he collapsed again the next day and was unconscious for several minutes, and after seeing a nurse was transferred to a local hospital where he suffered a cardiac arrest on Friday.
During his trial he accused his victims of being fantasists
The Ministry of Justice confirmed Clifford died in hospital on 10 December.
In May 2014, Clifford was jailed after being convicted of a eight historical indecent assaults on women and young girls under Operation Yewtree - the Met Police investigation set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.
During this trial, evidence was heard about Clifford's manipulative behaviour, including how he promised to boost the careers of aspiring models and actresses in return for sexual favours.
After his convictions, he continued to protest his innocence.
The Court of Appeal was due to hear his case appealing against his sentence in the New Year.
Clifford's lawyer, John Szepietowski, said his death meant there were a number of unresolved legal issues.
He said he Clifford was suing News International and Mirror Group Newspapers for allegedly hacking his phone.
His daughter Louise supported him through his trial
The lawyer also said Clifford was being sued by a number of women who claimed he had sexually assaulted them.
Mr Szepietowski said his legal team would meet in the coming days to decide whether Clifford's criminal appeal case should continue.
He said Clifford had been receiving legal aid for the appeal, after being declared bankrupt earlier this year and having to sell his Surrey home to pay his debts.
During his long career as a publicist, Clifford, who started his own company at 27, looked after press and publicity for a mixed range of clients such as Marlon Brando, Marvin Gaye, Muhammad Ali and Jade Goody.
He had helped to launch the career of The Beatles by sending press releases about their debut single, Love Me Do, when record company bosses were unsure about the group's potential.
High-profile clients came to him because of his connections in the tabloid press - while journalists turned to Clifford to provide stories.
However, after 50 years in the showbiz industry allegations against him began to emerge.
In a Facebook post following the announcement that Clifford had died, former X Factor winner Steve Brookstein, claimed he had ""orchestrated a media hate campaign"" against him.

"Charli Howard: Is this really a 'plus-size' model?
Charli Howard isn't short of an opinion or six.
""Models are models for a reason,"" the 26-year-old tells BBC News. ""Not everyone photographs in the same way.""
It's a refreshingly blunt assessment of the workings of the fashion world, and perhaps an unusual one for a member of the inclusion-championing body positivity movement.
""You don't want to see your mate Janet in Vogue, you want to see people you can aspire to. I think we want to look for people whose lives seem a bit more glamorous than our own.""
While Charli thinks models shouldn't look too ordinary (sorry Janet), the key thing is that aspirational beauty ""shouldn't be associated with just one body type"".
""I look at models like Ashley Graham, who are like size 16, and I still want to be Ashley Graham, 'cause she's cool as hell,"" she says.
""I don't think women are necessarily drawn to body shapes, I think it's about the personalities of women in magazines and what they stand for.""
Ashley Graham is one of the most high-profile plus-size models
Charli has just published her first book, Misfit - a memoir that deals openly with her problems with eating disorders and mental health.
She says she struggled to fit in during her school years, which led to her suffering from anxiety and ultimately being attracted to modelling as a way to escape her surroundings.
""I didn't know what I wanted to do as a career, and then I kept getting scouted and people said, 'You should try modelling',"" she explains.
""Now, for someone who lived in the middle of Wales at boarding school who felt completely alone, modelling was like this glamorous way out.
""So the book is about someone who was a bit unstable in the brain, how I chased this idea that if I finally got to my dream weight or got accepted by the modelling elite that I would finally be happy.""

Charli lays bare the multiple casting calls she went to, where she was regularly told she was too big for a certain client or campaign - despite having drastically altered her diet.
One rejection prompted her to write a Facebook post, which rapidly went viral, calling out the industry for its demands.
""I refuse to feel ashamed and upset on a daily basis for not meeting your ridiculous, unattainable beauty standards,"" she wrote.
Ironically, the attention from the post led to interest from a modelling agency in the US. Charli looked into their background and found they had a ""curve division"".
Within a few days, she had flown out to meet them and signed up. She now lives in the US full-time, working as a model - albeit one who is classed as plus-size.
""I have a D-cup. I have hips. I'm never going to fit the super-skinny category any more,"" she says. ""If we're going by industry standards, I'm only going to fit the curved market.
""There isn't really a section for me. There's no-one really representing the UK size 10-12, you either have to be really skinny or really big.
""And I am one of a handful of people trying to show that you can model at this natural size. And it's slap bang in the middle of both categories. And you can still do fashion. That's my whole point.""

Charli may be a healthy weight now, but has struggled with anorexia and bulimia throughout her life - conditions she acknowledges are difficult for many to comprehend.
when she suggested anorexia was a disease of the western world.
""No-one has anorexia in societies where there is not enough food,"" she told the Sunday Times.
""They do not have anorexia in the camps in Syria. I think it's possible anorexia could be about narcissism.""
but several columnists agreed with her - including Angela Epstein in
, who said it was a ""primarily middle-class illness"".
I raise this point cautiously with Charli, but she's quite understanding of this view.
""One of the earliest cases of anorexia was one of Henry VIII's wives. Really upper class,"" she says - referring to
""Poor people wouldn't have had that because they didn't have access to food, they wouldn't starve themselves.
""So I do kind of question if having access to food is maybe a factor. I had access to food and therefore also had the ability to restrict it.
""It's the class system, if you have money, you can afford to restrict, if you don't then you can't... I know that's quite a controversial thing.""
But, she adds, her main reason for minimising her diet was down to ""a society that really put pressure on me to lose weight"".
Jan 28, 2018 at 12:46pm PST
End of Instagram post 3 by charlihoward

Many people will, of course, find the suggestion that Charli is now considered plus-size utterly ridiculous. Including, she says, other plus-size models.
""Plus-size in an industry term, that's not something I've given myself. And I've had very successful plus-size models say to me 'Well you're not plus-size, I find that really offensive.'
""But what I'm looking for is the unification of women, and to see women on one board, where they don't have to be put into categories based on their sizes.""
She admits: ""I'm very young to be a plus-size model, most of them are in their 30s. And the 'straight-size' models, their work kind of dies out around 25, 30 if they're lucky. So I do feel quite lucky in that respect.""
Charli says there's ""tonnes"" of work out there for models larger than the average size, ""especially in America, not so much in the UK"".
She adds: ""This is what I don't understand. I think the UK still has these qualms or these weird association with the term 'plus-size'.""
Mar 16, 2017 at 10:17am PDT
End of Instagram post 4 by charlihoward
Image Copyright charlihoward
The rise of social media since Charli's school days, and Instagram in particular, has, if anything, reinforced beauty stereotypes, making the voice of more diverse figures more powerful.
""Fitspo accounts, thinspo accounts [short for fitspiration and thinspiration], you see models who are super-toned - I think that sends a completely different message as well, so it must be really tough,"" she says.
""I don't think I could be a teenager now. I think I would literally have a breakdown if I was a teenager now.
""But I think that's exactly why we need the Body Positive movement.""

"£60m fund to make more British kids' TV
Mr Bean's animated adventures have been a hit for more than 100 episodes on ITV
The government is giving commercial broadcasters including Channel 4 and ITV an extra £60m to compete with BBC children's programmes.
The money is to be spent over three years and will be used to encourage more home-grown programmes.
Teletubbies creator Anne Wood, said the funding had come at the right time, adding: ""We desperately need more support.""
The £60m pot will come from the 2010 licence fee settlement.
Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said it would give the children's TV sector ""the boost it needs to create innovative content for a wider audience that would otherwise not be made"".
The money will be available for programmes shown by commercial public service broadcasters - including ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 - as well as other ""free and widely available"" channels and streaming services, and potentially other online platforms.
Teletubbies creator Anne Wood, who leads the Save Kids' Content UK campaign, said she was ""deeply grateful"" for the move.
'Never had such difficult times'
""It shows the government's awareness of the issue and the importance of children's television culture to children in this country,"" she told BBC News.
""We in the children's production sector have never had such difficult times raising finance. We desperately need more support.""
The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said the fund could be used to pay for up to 50% of the production and distribution costs of original TV shows.
Programmes from new and diverse backgrounds, and those made in the nations and regions, will be ""a particular focus"", it said.
The government said the fund would ""stimulate greater variety in a market where the BBC is often the dominant buyer and broadcaster"" of children's shows.
The Teletubbies are among Britain's most successful children's TV exports, underlining the BBC's dominance in the sector
Spending on first-run home-grown children's programming by public service broadcasters fell by 26% to £84m between 2006-16.
In 2016, CBBC and CBeebies accounted for 87% of all such children's programming.
Although ITV no longer has the daily offering of children's TV shows that many children of the 1970s and 1980s will remember, it does screen a range of children's programmes on its channels, often to be seen on ITV early on weekend mornings.
- described as an entertainment game show challenging child contestants to solve puzzles and crack codes - that will be on air from 7 January.
Its other popular shows include the animated adventures of Mr Bean, the Saturday morning show Scrambled! and the comedy Bottom Knocker Street.
The announcement of the extra funding comes after media watchdog Ofcom was given new powers to set quotas for children's shows on public service broadcasters.

"Germany's Daimler issues 'full apology' to China over Dalai Lama
The now-deleted post was shown on the Twitter feed of the official Chinese newspaper People's Daily - that post has also now been deleted
Daimler has issued a second emphatic apology to China after its subsidiary, Mercedes Benz, quoted the Dalai Lama in an Instagram post on Monday.
for the post on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, on Tuesday.
China sees the Tibetan spiritual leader of the autonomous region as a separatist threat.
The advert showed a car with the words: ""Look at situations from all angles, and you will become more open.""
Instagram is blocked in China, but the post was reposted by Chinese internet users, causing a commotion.
The official Chinese news agency, Xinhua, said the German carmaker had written to China's ambassador to Germany expressing a sincere apology.
According to Xinhua, the letter said Daimler had no intention of questioning Beijing's sovereignty over Tibet and would offer ""no support, assistance, aid or help to anyone who intentionally subverts or attempts to subvert China's sovereignty and territorial integrity"".
""Daimler deeply regrets the hurt and grief that its negligent and insensitive mistake has caused to the Chinese people. Daimler fully and unreservedly recognises the seriousness of the situation, which the company has caused and sincerely apologises for,"" the letter apparently read.
China sees the Dalai Lama as mounting a separatist campaign from exile
, which said it ""lacks sincerity and reflects the German carmaker's lack of understanding of Chinese culture and values"".
It is not the first instance of frantic corporate backtracking after causing offence in one of the world's largest consumer markets.
, after the firm listed Tibet and others as separate countries in a Chinese-language questionnaire to customers.
The problem was compounded when Twitter users noticed that the hotel chain's official Twitter account had ""liked"" a post by Friends of Tibet - a group that supports Tibetan independence.
Marriott went on to begin dismissal proceedings against the employee responsible.
China has for centuries claimed sovereignty over
and sent in troops to enforce its rule in 1950. The Dalai Lama fled after a failed uprising in 1959 and is now in exile in India.

"Daytime wounds 'heal more quickly'
Health and science correspondent, BBC News
Wounds heal more quickly if they occur during the day rather than after dark, a study suggests.
It found burns sustained at night took an average of 28 days to heal, but just 17 for those that happened in daytime.
The team, at the UK's MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, said they were astounded by the difference they saw in 118 burns patients they studied.
The effect was explained by the way body clock ticks inside nearly every human cell across a 24-hour cycle.
, examined 118 patients at NHS burns units.
It showed the average 11-day difference in healing times between people hurt at night and during the day.
Detailed lab work showed skin cells called fibroblasts were changing their abilities in a 24-hour pattern.
Fibroblasts are the body's first responders, rushing to the site of injury to close a wound.
During the day they are primed to react, but they lose this ability at night.
Dr John O'Neill, one of the researchers, told the BBC: ""It is like the 100m. The sprinter down on the blocks, poised and ready to go, is always going to beat the guy going from a standing start.""
The researchers think they could use this knowledge to improve surgery.
Some drugs, such as the steroid cortisol, can reset an individual cell's body clock and may be helpful in night-time procedures.
And everybody's body clock runs to a slightly different pattern or ""chronotype"".
So, it might make sense to schedule operations to keep in time with the patients' 24-hour ""circadian rhythms"".
Both ideas are still untested, though.
Dr John Blaikley, a clinician scientist at the University of Manchester, said: ""Treatment of wounds costs the NHS around £5bn, which is partly due to a lack of effective therapies targeting wound closure.
""By taking these [circadian factors] into account, not only could novel drug targets be identified, but also the effectiveness of established therapies might be increased through changing what time of day they are given.""

The BBC have contacted Facebook for comment.
Unilad, which has offices in London and Manchester, was founded in 2010. In 2012, it was shut down but relaunched in 2014 under new owners Liam Harrington and Sam Bentley.
It was named as one of Facebook's most popular pages last year, news that was shared by Sam Bentley
""We got over 25 billion video views and nearly 1 billion people liked, commented or shared our content,"" he posted.
But the account has also generated criticism by some social media users questioning the authenticity of some of its content.
In October 2016, 17 million people viewed a ""live"" feed from the International Space Station on Unilad's Facebook page,
But with 34 million followers, the site had built up a huge following keen to see viral content regardless of its origins.

Last seven majors won by first-time champions
Royal Birkdale hosts 146th Open this week
Eight straight, or end of an era?
It's the big question at the British Open at Royal Birkdale this week.
That's because the last seven majors have been clinched by first-time winners.
Brooks Koepka, Sergio Garcia, Jimmy Walker, Henrik Stenson, Dustin Johnson, Danny Willett and Jason Day all recently joined the major club.
Add Zach Johnson and Jordan Spieth's second of back-to-back titles at the 2015 US Open and the streak of different major champions extends to nine.
That's more than two years without a major winner adding to their tally and status in the game.
Is that good, or bad for golf? Does it spread the love, or dilute the interest?
Brooks Koepka: Why golf is my job, not my life
Brooks Koepka: Why golf is my job, not my life
""I think it's a really impressive stat and it speaks to the state of the game. A lot of tremendous young players right now,"" Spieth told reporters at Royal Birkdale Tuesday.
""And then you've got guys like Henrik and Dustin who...have been around in contention many, many times. It was just a matter of time for them.""
It's clear, though, that nine years since the last of Tiger Woods' 14 majors, golf is still recalibrating.
Woods was blockbuster, of course, and brought huge amounts of money to the game.
The sport -- fans, sponsors, tournament organizers, TV executives -- had become used to a dominant figure.
Even in the era of the Big Three -- Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player -- there was a rivalry.
But when the likes of David Duval, Ernie Els, Vijay Singh and Phil Mickelson had a nibble at Woods he swatted them all away.
Since Woods' record streak of 281 weeks at world No.1 came to an end in 2010 there have been nine different top-ranked players flip-flopping for No.1, including Woods himself again for a 60-week spell in 2013-2014.
The British Open rotates around 10 of the best links golf courses in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. St. Andrews (pictured) is known as the ""Home of Golf"" and its Old Course is arguably the game's most hallowed turf.
Golf has been played over the dunes and linksland of St. Andrews since the 15th Century. The clubhouse of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club stands sentinel over the unique layout which starts and finishes in town.
There are six courses squeezed onto St. Andrews' links, with the Old Course at their heart. The Road Hole 17th and 18th form an iconic finishing stretch.
The Old Course is known for its blind drives over seas of gorse, vast greens, and swales, humps and hollows which require imagination and the ability to use the ground to your advantage.
The 2017 Open Championship will take place at Royal Birkdale in Lancashire, northwest England. It has been in existence since 1897 and is easily recognized by its 1930s art-deco clubhouse.
This powerhouse of a links features flat fairways and fair greens with holes framed by towering dunes.
Perhaps best known now for being owned by US President Donald Trump, Turnberry on Scotland's west coast is a spectacular Open venue which underwent a recent revamp.
The Ailsa course occupies a sublime location overlooking the Firth of Clyde with sweeping views to the Ailsa Craig rock and the Isle of Arran.
The classic old links on Scotland's Ayrshire coast last hosted the Open in 2016 when Henrik Stenson won a famous duel against Phil Mickelson on the final day. Scotland's Colin Montgomerie (pictured) is a Troon native.
The course is famed for its devilish par-three eighth hole, dubbed the ""Postage Stamp."" It's only 123 yards long but provides a stiff test in the wind, with deep bunkers and a thin green.
Northeast of Dundee on Scotland's east coast lies the fearsome links of Carnoustie, known as one of the toughest courses on the Open calendar.
The Championship course is on many golfers' bucket list and is famed as the venue where Jean Van de Velde paddled in the burn during a final-hole collapse in 1999.
The jewel in the crown of Scotland's ""Golf Coast"" of East Lothian, Muirfield is a celebrated if controversial Open venue.
The testing track near Gullane has been mired in controversy after the club voted -- at the second attempt -- to admit female members.
Royal Lytham & St. Annes:
Nestled in a pocket of duneland surrounded by houses and a railway track, Royal Lytham in northwest England retains a charming links quality.
Royal Lytham & St. Annes:
The relatively short course still provides a tough test with 206 bunkers to navigate. South African Ernie Els won the last Open here in 2012.
Out on the Wirral peninsula to the west of Liverpool lies the course commonly known as Hoylake, a venerable old links overlooking the Irish Sea.
Legendary golf scribe Bernard Darwin once wrote: ""Hoylake, blown upon by mighty winds, breeder of mighty champions."" Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy have both won the Open here.
The furthest south of the Open venues in England, Royal St. George's is a quintessential links overlooking the North Sea in Kent.
It is a testing mix of undulating fairways, slick greens and daunting bunkers.
Hugging Antrim's north coast, Royal Portrush returns to the Open rotation in 2019, the first time the tournament has been hosted outside England or Scotland since it hosted the 1951 event.
The Dunluce course is one of the world's most celebrated links layouts hugging the cliff tops and overlooking the Irish Sea with views to Donegal in the west and Scotland in the east.
Spieth is convinced Woods' supremacy was a one-off.
""I doubt you'll see a dominance like that maybe ever again in the game,"" he said.
""What Tiger's done -- having experienced a year like he continued to do for years -- it just takes a lot out of you. It's very tough to do. And you have to have a lot of things go right at the right times.""
When Woods had to miss the second half of 2008 for knee surgery after winning the US Open, Ireland's Padraig Harrington stepped into the breach, winning the last two majors of the year, including the Open at Royal Birkdale.
But Harrington's flame blew itself out and his US PGA win sparked a run of 16 different major winners, nine of whom hadn't won one before or since, as Woods battled off-course issues and an ensuing loss of form.
Rory McIlroy snapped this streak with his second major, the 2012 US PGA to add to the 2011 US Open.
And when McIlroy won the British Open and the US PGA within three weeks in 2014, it cemented his status as ""The One."" Only he, Nicklaus and Woods had won three, and then four, majors by the age of 25.
The Northern Irishman needed just the Masters to become only the sixth player ever to win all four of golf's major titles at some stage in his career.
But the Masters became McIlroy's nemesis, and as he faltered in his Augusta quest, Spieth stepped forward.
What's the best shot Tiger Woods ever hit?
What's the best shot Tiger Woods ever hit?
A record-breaking Masters win at the age of 21, second youngest only to Woods, followed two months later by a US Open suggested golf had been too hasty in naming McIlroy as Tiger's true successor.
Spieth was set to confirm as much at the 2016 Masters as he stood on the 10th tee with a five-shot lead in the final round. Back-to-back titles at Augusta, both won wire-to-wire, would arguably eclipse anything McIlroy had achieved.
But, like McIlroy himself in 2011, Spieth suffered an infamous meltdown, putting two balls in the water on the 12th to ultimately miss out to Willett.
Meanwhile, Australian Day had finally fulfilled his potential with victory at the 2015 US PGA. A formidable end to the year ushered him to No. 1 spot to end the Spieth-McIlroy horsetrading.
A new ""Big Three"" was emerging. The trio all enjoyed spells of brilliance, but none could quite sustain the highs.
Golf had become used to Woods' win ratio -- 18% in the majors and nearly 25% in PGA Tour events.
It's taken a while to realize that wasn't normal. The next best of those with more than 10 wins in regular events is McIlroy at about 10%.
Jason Day: If I want it, no one can beat me
Jason Day: If I want it, no one can beat me
Living proof that winning is difficult comes from the greatest of them all, Nicklaus. Behind the record 18 major titles lie 19 second-place finishes.
With Spieth, McIlroy and Day misfiring, Johnson finally crossed the threshold after a raft of near misses with his maiden major at the 2016 US Open.
""I was just fed up with, you know, being good. I thought I could be a lot better,"" Johnson told CNN of the catalyst behind his success.
Three straight tournament wins heading into Augusta in April suggested the powerful American was emerging from a fledgling ""Big Four"" to be the dominant No.1.
But a slip down stairs on the eve of the Masters put him on the sidelines, and he missed the cut at the US Open.
Spieth, meanwhile, is still looking to add to his major tally, although he recently rekindled comparisons with Woods with a 10th title before the age of 24.
McIlroy missed a spell with a rib injury and is suffering a mini slump after a spectacular end to 2016.
And Day is also struggling to rediscover the form that took him to No.1 in September 2015. His mother's lung cancer has been a major distraction, too. ""Golf is like life, there's ups and downs,"" said McIlroy Wednesday. ""It's never that linear sort of direction.""
Spieth even suggested there was no such thing as a Big Four in the current game. ""I'm not sure who it would be,"" he said at Royal Birkdale.
Sergio Garcia reflects on Masters win
Sergio Garcia reflects on Masters win
Of the 164 players to have won one of the 320 majors since the Masters was introduced in 1934, only 35% have gone on to win more.
Indeed, Garcia's breakthrough win at the Masters came in his 74th major.
Spieth added: ""I think it's going to be a very exciting time going forward. You'll see a group of ten to 12 guys over the next 15, 20 years that are going to have a lot of different competitions that come down the stretch with each other. It's different than one person being the guy to beat.""
With Garcia off the list, Fowler arguably inherited the dubious honor of being the best of the current crop yet to win a major.
The Californian finished in the top five in all four majors in 2014, and the 28-year-old had to settle for another fifth place in the US Open at Erin Hills last month.
""You have to measure success in different ways, not just by winning, just because that doesn't happen a whole lot,"" he said.
Some good players never even won a major, such as eight-time European No. 1 Colin Montgomerie, who had five runner-up spots. Or England's former world No. 1 Lee Westwood despite three seconds and six thirds.
Plenty of good players have only won one, such as another former world No.1 Duval, while others have reached the pinnacle once and sunk without trace.
And some great players never won certain majors -- Palmer couldn't win the US PGA, Lee Trevino didn't win the Masters and Greg Norman suffered widespread heartache, but particularly at the Masters.
So while the Spieth/McIlroy/Day/Johnson axis realigns, others will fill in the gaps, like grains of sand.
Dustin Johnson: Fed up with just being good
Dustin Johnson: Fed up with just being good
Golf is, and in truth always has been, in a state of flux. Great players and rivalries come and go.
From small acorns grow great oaks, and each first-time major winner could be on the brink of something special.
At this week's Open venue all but two of the previous nine champions were already major winners, and of those Peter Thomson added another four Opens to his 1954 title at the Southport track.
History would suggest someone will enhance their status as a multiple major champion.
But with a raft of players stepping up, the new normal could see number eight come in at Royal Birkdale.

"BMA chief: NHS is 'running on fumes'
The NHS in England is ""running on fumes"", the leader of the British Medical Association is warning.
Dr Mark Porter hit out at the government at the start of the union's annual conference.
He accused ministers of putting patients at risk and ""picking the pockets"" of NHS staff because of the squeeze on wages.
But ministers rejected the criticisms, saying they were putting more money into the health service.
Dr Porter launched the attack as doctors gathered in Bournemouth.
He said: ""We have a government trying to keep the health service running on nothing but fumes. A health service at breaking point.
""Run by ministers who wilfully ignore the pleas of the profession and the impact on patients.
""It doesn't have to be this way. It is the result of an explicit political choice.""
Dr Mark Porter said: ""The government wants a world-class NHS with a third class settlement.""
He went on to point out that compared to other developed economies, less was being spent on the NHS than other health systems.
And he said this was having a direct impact on patients, pointing to the rise in the numbers of patients facing long waits for a bed following an emergency admission - up four-fold in five years - as proof.
""The government wants a world-class NHS with a third class settlement,"" he said.
It comes as the BMA unveiled the results of a poll of more than 1,000 adults on the state of the NHS.
82% were worried about the future of the NHS

More people were dissatisfied with the NHS - 43% - than were satisfied - 33%

He said the NHS was seeing the ""highest cancer survival rates ever"", improving mental health services and better access to GPs.
He also added independent polling showed pubic satisfaction rates were also high in contrast to the BMA poll.

"Harriet Harman: Give MPs six months' paid maternity leave
Members of Parliament should be given six months' maternity leave, during which a colleague can cast votes on their behalf, Harriet Harman has said.
The former Labour deputy leader, who has had three children while an MP, said a ""proper system of baby leave"" in Parliament was ""long overdue"".
Currently maternity and paternity arrangements in Parliament are informal and operate at the party level.
Ms Harman said 17 babies had been born to women MPs since 2010.
Under the current system, MPs are not considered employees and are therefore not given formal maternity or paternity leave, and cannot vote if they choose to stay at home.
Ms Harman said this system was ""unacceptable"", adding: ""The baby needs time with the mother, the mother needs time with the baby and the constituency needs to be properly represented at all times.""
Ms Harman, who has campaigned for
, said a policy of six months' paid leave would put MPs in line with the civil service.
The former Labour deputy leader said MPs should be able to nominate a full-time paid ""maternity cover"" to represent the constituency in their absence.
""Eighteen months' leave for three babies during 35 years' work doesn't seem too much to ask,"" said Ms Harman, who is the longest continuously-serving female MP.
She added: ""The reality is you cannot be on call for your constituency or voting when you are in labour.""
Parliament now has a record 208 women MPs, making up 32% of the House of Commons, many of whom are of child-bearing age.
so she could take part in the Article 50 vote on the UK leaving the EU in February.
Meanwhile, MP Tulip Siddiq, who had her first child in April 2016, has spoken of the lack of support for young mothers in Parliament, telling the
: ""HR said to me 'there's no standardised maternity leave' and that they haven't had to deal with this 'problem' very often.""
Ms Harman submitted her maternity proposals to the cross-party Commons Reference Group on Representation and Inclusion, which meets next week, and is due to make recommendations on maternity, paternity, parental, adoption and caring leave.
Who said what, when, and what happened next?
into women in Parliament written by Prof Sarah Childs suggested MPs nursing an infant should be able to vote from home, or nominate a proxy voter who could also table questions and amendments in Parliament.
Ms Harman has previously spoken about being unable to take maternity leave while representing her Camberwell and Peckham constituency.
""I was too much on the defensive to insist on formal maternity leave, feeling I had to give the impression that I was coping with everything,"" she wrote in her autobiography, A Woman's Work.

"Wells Fargo boss should be be fired, says senator
Washington senators have criticised Wells Fargo, saying the US bank had not done enough to reform the corporate culture that led to the creation of millions of fake accounts.
Senator Elizabeth Warren called for the chief executive, Tim Sloan, to be fired and board members replaced.
Others asked if regulators should revoke the bank's charter.
Mr Sloan, who was appointed following the scandal over sales practices, said the firm had taken steps.
""We've made fundamental changes to the way we do business,"" he said at a congressional hearing in Washington on Tuesday.
The practice of illegally opening accounts was designed to boost sales targets.
Last year regulators fined the the bank more than $180m over the issue.
Wells Fargo said in August that as many as 3.5 million accounts may have been created for customers without their permission over about eight years, even more than it had previously acknowledged.
It also said it had uncovered problems with the bank's online payment system and admitted to wrongly charging customers for car insurance.
On Tuesday, Mr Sloan, a long time executive at the bank, maintained the most serious problems were limited to the firm's retail banking unit.
Senators criticised the company for continuing to force customers to pursue claims outside of court, among other practices.
""Wells Fargo is not going to change with you in charge,"" Ms Warren said.

"Border counties to hold Brexit meeting
The councils will gather in Enniskillen
Councils along the Irish border are to meet later in County Fermanagh to discuss the impact of Brexit.
The local authorities will discuss a report which sets out some of the risks and opportunities to the border area after the UK leaves the EU.
The study found that some of the weakest economies on the island of Ireland are along the border.
These areas are most in need of protection against any negative impacts of Brexit, the report added.
Bridge across the River Termon which divides Pettigo marking the border between Counties Fermanagh and Donegal
The Ulster University Economic Policy Centre study says while the proposed shape of Brexit is becoming much clearer, the risk posed or opportunities presented remain a matter of speculation and will need to be made subject to revision on an ongoing basis.
It states that border businesses rely more on the 3bn euros (£2.5bn) cross-border trade and Republic of Ireland/GB trade rather than exports to the rest of the EU or further afield.
This trade is dominated by sales of goods by the agri-food, building materials and chemicals sectors which are exposed to risks of significant tariffs and non-tariff barriers, such as an end to common standards.
The report says EU funding, which is worth upwards of 5bn euros (£4.2bn) to the border corridor to 2020, will depend on mitigation from other funding sources.
An old customs hut dating back to the 1920s
This money, ranging from Common Agricultural Policy and skills development programmes, to cross-border and peace funds, will end for Northern Ireland after Brexit.
Foreign direct investment has delivered more than 7,000 jobs to the area in the past five years, and Brexit will bring risks and large opportunities depending on access to the EU market, the report says.
It says ""like cross-border shopping, this is a competitive area for councils although it may need to be explored how to adopt a joint approach to sell the corridor as a whole in the context of Brexit"".
The Termon Complex, a centre for sport and entertainment was paid for by the EU peace fund
In 2015 almost a million cross-border journeys were made every week at border crossings to access work, education and other services.
Freedom of movement is also critical for the more than three million visitors to the border corridor in 2015 whose expenditure amounted to more than 600m euros (£507m).
The report recommends that councils work collectively as a lobby group to show that the border corridor is going to be most affected by Brexit and to have their voices heard in the negotiations.

"Heads worried tuition fee pledge for teachers to be dropped
The tuition fee relief was intended to attract more people into teaching
Head teachers in England are concerned that the promise of university tuition fee relief for teachers may be axed.
The Conservative manifesto proposed that teachers would not repay tuition fees while they remained in teaching - to help tackle staffing shortages.
Many other education policies have been ditched - and heads' leader Russell Hobby says he is concerned the new government has ""gone quiet"" on fees.
He called for urgent clarification on whether the plan was being dropped.
A statement from the Department for Education said: ""We want the best teachers working in our schools and are investing in various initiatives to attract high quality graduates in an increasingly competitive jobs market.
""We will provide more details on how we will take forward these proposals in due course.""
But the department would not elaborate on whether that meant the fee relief plan would or would not go ahead.
The manifesto proposal would have provided an incentive for more graduates to enter teaching and to improve retention - with the promise of not having to make tuition fee repayments while they stayed in the profession.
The policy promised ""forgiveness on student loan repayments while they are teaching"", raising the prospect that people who remained in teaching during their careers could save on fees that are set to rise to Â£9,250 per year.
This had been welcomed by school leaders, who have complained about worsening problems of teacher shortages.
But in the wake of the election result, many of the Conservatives' education plans are no longer going ahead - including the expansion of grammar schools.
The Queen's Speech set out no plans for any education legislation.
School leaders are concerned that the proposal for teachers and tuition fees could also disappear.
""Recent data shows that we are struggling to recruit and retain teachers and this is leading to serious difficulties in schools,"" said Mr Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers.
""We need to think creatively about ways to attract talented people into the profession and so it would be disappointing if ideas like this get put on the back burner.""
Mr Hobby said this was part of wider concerns about a lack of clarity over school funding plans.
""Funding has a huge impact on recruitment and school leaders will be worried that the government has gone quiet on its proposals of tuition fee relief for people studying to be teachers.
""The government must clarify this point urgently.""
Another head teachers' leader, Geoff Barton, pointed to rising levels of vacancies in schools, and said that staffing shortages reflected the lack of pay rises.
""The problem is that we aren't attracting enough people into teaching in the first place, and then we are not retaining enough of them,"" said Mr Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union.
""The government has to lift the teaching pay cap and better incentivise teaching, and it has to work with the teaching profession to develop a career strategy which better develops and retains staff.""
Earlier this year, the cross-party Education Select Committee warned of ""significant teacher shortages"" and called for a more effective long-term plan to ensure an adequate supply of teachers.

"Donald Trump still on Theresa May's Christmas card list
Theresa May has sent a Christmas card to Donald Trump, Downing Street says.
A spokesman could not say which of the PM's three official cards - designed by children in her Maidenhead constituency - was sent to the White House.
But responding to reporters' questions, he confirmed the US president - who
- was still on the Christmas card list.
Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, has based his card on Labour's election manifesto.
Mrs May's three cards were unveiled last week.
Chosen through a competition for schoolchildren, they feature a reindeer, Santa Claus in his sleigh and Downing Street festooned with Christmas decorations.
The Labour leader opted for a different approach - choosing a design invoking the cover of his party's 2017 general election manifesto, with people's heads and shoulders outlined in white on a red background.
In the festive version, The Many Not the Few are wearing reindeer antlers and party hats.

"Can Toshiba escape fate of corporate Japan's zombie hordes?
Another of Japan's corporate behemoths faces the prospect of biting the dust
Once a household name, Toshiba is now bleeding billions of dollars and frantically trying to reassure investors that it will not succumb to the kiss of death.
But it also faces another fate: becoming the most high-profile member of Japan's corporate living dead, also known as zombie firms.
Toshiba admitted this week that its
and that the firm could be delisted from the Tokyo stock exchange, following a
and an ill-timed bet on nuclear power.
The 142-year-old company is poised to record Japan's biggest industrial loss after its investment in US nuclear unit
So what's next? Well, a lot hinges on Toshiba's ability to raise much-needed cash through the sale of its valuable memory chip unit.
Here are three possible scenarios.
Toshiba is already the ""walking dead"" financially, says Gerhard Fasol, chief executive of Eurotechnology Japan: ""Action should have been taken 20 years ago"".
Zombie companies are loosely defined as loss-making or insolvent entities that should be allowed to fail, but continue to operate because of lenient creditors.
Thousands exist in Japan and the issue is considered to be a reason why Japan's economy risks suffering from a third ""lost decade"".
Why is Toshiba on the ropes?
All Toshiba needs now is a bailout from the
or the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation, two government-backed bodies that rescue ailing companies, for this to happen.
However, many investors are not fans of this option. They argue that zombie firms need to be killed off, so that
Amir Anvarzadeh of BGC Partners said if the government gets involved, ""then we suspect we will find Toshiba back on the brink again sometime in the the future.""
Want more proof of zombies? Not a single publicly-listed Japanese firm went bust last year. In fact, overall bankruptcies have
Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, touts those statistics as a sign of economic success, but being saved from going extinct is not necessarily a good thing.
Innovation and new firm creation remains incredibly low in Japan compared with other developed countries,
Breaking up is hard to do. But Toshiba President Satoshi Tsunakawa has no other choice but to sell off some prized parts if he wants to keep the company afloat and alive.
Toshiba President Satoshi Tsunakawa (right) has a massive financial headache on his hands
Toshiba is in the process of auctioning off its semiconductor unit, which makes memory chips for smartphones, computers and other electronic devices.
It is the world's second-largest chip manufacturer behind Samsung, which is no mean feat, given how competitive the industry is.
Over the last two years, there has been an aggressive wave of consolidation. So when Toshiba's unit was put up for grabs, an array of interested bidders quickly assembled.
The chip unit is estimated to be worth between $9bn (Â£7.2bn) and $13bn. Taiwan's Foxconn, which assembles Apple's iPhones, has reportedly offered as much as $27bn.
last year. But things could easily change.
The chip sale is now said to be facing opposition from various stakeholders, including US firm Western Digital, which has a joint venture deal with Toshiba.
The Japanese government is also believed to be reluctant to allow the sale of another company with proprietary technologies to a Chinese or South Korean rival.
BGC Partners' Mr Anvarzadeh dismisses the latter. ""Arguments that technology transfer ultimately trickle down to China sound dubious,"" he says, adding that Taiwan and Korea have more advanced chip technologies anyway.
3. Off the menu - collapse
If the chip sale falls through, more accounting irregularities emerge or the banks decide to call in their loans, then all bets are off.
Toshiba could be allowed to fail. But that would have serious ramifications and will see thousands of shareholders lose their savings. Then there is the issue of national pride.
Toshiba launched the world's first mass-market laptop in 1985 and became known for its consumer electronics products such as televisions, although it is worth stating those units are no longer at the heart of its business and some are loss-making.
In addition, the decline of Japan Inc, once renowned the world over for its game-changing companies, has been
After 142 years of existence, is Toshiba now toast?
Analysts pretty much all agree that Toshiba is in a difficult, complicated situation. But they differ on the probable course of action.
Eurotechnology's Mr Fasol is predicting a ""politically brokered solution"", in which a US firm and a Japanese government investment fund acquire the chip company.
But Mr Anvarzadeh believes Toshiba should be allowed to sell the unit to Foxconn, because it is willing to pay the highest price.
""Pride is very expensive. I don't think the government can afford to be proud with Toshiba on the brink,"" he said.
""We think the best case scenario is for the Japanese government to stay out of this bidding process and, for once, allow market forces to run their course.""

"'Egregious' YouTubers to face consequences
Logan Paul produced a controversial video
YouTube says it is developing new policies to deal with video-makers who damage the reputation of the website.
Chief executive Susan Wojcicki said ""egregious"" behaviour by video bloggers caused ""significant harm"" to the entire community of video-makers.
The site has been under closer scrutiny after video blogger Logan Paul made a video which showed a dead body in a ""suicide forest"".
Many video-makers have been frustrated with YouTube's policies.
In a bid to stop advertisements appearing next to controversial content, YouTube has been using algorithms to identify content that it judges not to be ""advertiser-friendly"".
However, many of the platform's biggest stars have complained that their videos have been incorrectly marked as unsuitable for advertising.
YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki
YouTube creators have coined the words ""demonetisation"" and ""adpocalypse"" to describe the problem.
The platform has also been criticised for what video-makers perceive as a lack of transparency about its policies.
, Ms Wojcicki said she wanted to ""strengthen the trust that our community places in YouTube through open and frequent communication"".
Addressing the so-called adpocalypse, she said the company was ""working on a more accurate solution"" that would involve more human moderators to review videos.
""We're also currently developing policies that would lead to consequences if a creator does something egregious that causes significant harm to our community as a whole,"" she added.
When Mr Paul uploaded his video recorded in the suicide forest, YouTube removed him from the Google Preferred programme, which sells premium advertising for the website's top 5% of video-makers.
Mr Paul has since apologised for uploading the video.
The company says it wants to have clear policies for content creators to follow.
""While these instances are rare, they can damage the reputation and revenue of your fellow creators,"" said Ms Wojcicki.
""We want to make sure we have policies in place that allow us to respond appropriately.""
One of the platform's best-known stars, Hank Green, welcomed the blog post.
""I am often critical of YouTube, but I also have a lot of sympathy for the tightropes they must often walk,"" he said.
""Do I think they give in to advertisers too much? Yep! But to me this statement shows a very good and deep understanding of the issues the platform (and its creators) face.""
But others urged YouTube to enact its promises more quickly.

"Heather Locklear arrested: Actress accused of domestic assault
Ventura County Sheriff's Office
Heather Locklear has been released on bail
US actress Heather Locklear was arrested on Sunday for alleged domestic violence at her home near Los Angeles, police say.
She is also accused of three counts of battery against a sheriff's deputy.
Her brother dialled 911 after seeing the actress and her boyfriend fighting at her home in Thousand Oaks,
Sgt Eric Buschow of Ventura County Sheriff's Office said Ms Locklear, 56, was ""extremely hostile"".
The actress was arrested in 2008 on suspicion of driving under the influence of prescription medication
more police had to be called to the house because she was physically resisting arrest.
The officer said deputies had struggled to get Ms Locklear, a former star of US soap opera Melrose Place, into a police patrol car.
Ventura County Sheriff's Captain Garo Kuredjian said Ms Locklear's boyfriend had a physical injury, though he declined medical treatment.
The actress was taken to Ventura County Jail and released after posting $20,000 (Â£14,300) bail. She is due to appear in court on 13 March.
Ms Locklear, who was previously married to Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, first rose to fame as Sammy Jo Carrington in the 1980s TV show Dynasty.
As well as Melrose Place, she later appeared on TV police drama TJ Hooker and sitcom Spin City, for which she was twice nominated for a Golden Globe.
The actress had a previous brush with the authorities in 2008 when she was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of prescription medication.
She was fined $900 and sentenced to three years' informal probation after pleading guilty to reckless driving.

"Citizens Advice wants ban on unsolicited credit limit rises
One in five people struggling with debts has seen their credit card limit automatically increased - a higher proportion than for cardholders in general, a charity has claimed.
Citizens Advice said 18% of those struggling financially had seen the limit increased without request, compared with 12% overall.
It wants a ban on increases without a cardholder's explicit consent.
The regulator has estimated that 3.3 million people are in persistent debt.
In a report published earlier this year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that ""customers in persistent debt are profitable for credit card firms, who do not routinely intervene to help them"".
Recent industry figures have also showed a rise in the use of credit, debit and charge cards. The number of transactions grew by 12% in the year to the end of June, the highest annual rate since 2008. The value of spending also rose, accelerating to 7.2%.
to prove to regulators that they are not lending recklessly.
The Bank of England has consistently expressed the need for vigilance over growth in the consumer credit market during ""benign"" economic conditions, at a time when household income has been relatively stagnant.
The FCA has also proposed that credit card companies could cancel any interest or charges in extreme cases. Firms should have to work more closely with people in debt, such as drawing up a faster repayment plan, it proposed.
Now Citizens Advice has said that poor affordability checks by lenders were making people's financial situations worse.
""It is clear that irresponsible behaviour by some lenders is making people's debt situation worse - such as offering more credit when they already have thousands of pounds of unpaid debt,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice.
""The regulator must ensure that lenders are taking into account people's whole financial and personal situation before agreeing further credit.
""Banning firms from raising existing customers' credit limits without seeking their express permission first would also help people take more control over their finances.""
A spokesman for industry body UK Finance said: ""Helping customers struggling with persistent credit card debt is a priority for our members.
""The industry has already developed a number of proposals to address the regulator's concerns and ensure that no customer in persistent debt will be offered a credit limit increase.
""Where customers are in financial difficulty, the industry introduced a breathing space to allow customers to engage with a debt advice provider.""

Some they wanted proved impossible to locate, including Phillip Lindsay Mason's The Death Makers. But its importance is being marked at the exhibition all the same.
Godfrey explained: ""Even the artist doesn't know where it is. So we wanted to acknowledge its absence with a blank space.""
We Shall Survive Without a Doubt by Emory Douglas
As well as such iconic artworks as Warhol's portrait of Ali, the exhibition also looks at how art was reflected on the streets of America.
The Black Panther Party's culture minister Emory Douglas said that ""the ghetto itself is the gallery"" and was behind posters like the one above.

"General election 2017: Labour rules out tax rises for 95% of earners
Only the top 5% of earners will pay more tax, Labour will say
Labour is pledging not to raise income tax for those earning less than £80,000 a year as part of a ""personal tax guarantee"" for 95% of taxpayers.
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell will vow to protect low- and middle-earners by also ruling out rises in VAT and employee national insurance rates.
But he will say the top 5% of earners will pay more to fund public services.
The Tories, who have also ruled out a rise in VAT, say there is a £45bn black hole in Labour's tax proposals.
Theresa May has said she has ""no plans"" to raise other taxes after the election, but has so far declined to say whether a manifesto pledge not to raise direct taxes ahead of the 2015 election will be retained.
Chancellor Philip Hammond appeared to distance himself from the commitment when he said recently that ""greater flexibility"" would be needed in future to pay down the deficit and reduce levels of debt.
After a poor showing in Thursday's council elections, Labour has admitted that it faces a ""historic"" challenge to win the snap election on 8 June but Mr McDonnell has urged the party to ""come out fighting"".
In a major speech on Sunday, he will argue Labour is on the side of working families and seek to reassure middle earners about his plans. At the same time, he will accuse his opponents of keeping people ""in the dark"" about their own intentions.
Labour's shadow chancellor will say working families have borne the brunt of austerity
If Labour wins power, he says 95% of taxpayers will see no rise in their overall tax burden until 2022 by ruling out increases to the standard 20% rate of VAT, personal national insurance contributions and income tax rates for those earning under £80,000.
However, he will say those earning more than £80,000 will have to pay more, without giving specific details. At the moment, those earning more than £150,000 pay 45% tax on earnings above that level.
""The choice at this election is very clear on tax as there is currently only one party which is committing not to raise taxes on middle and low earners,"" he will say.
""The Labour Party is now the party of low taxes for middle and low earners while the Tories are the party of tax handouts for the super-rich and big corporations.""
Mr McDonnell, who has already signalled he would reverse cuts to capital gains tax, corporation tax and inheritance tax in the 2016 Budget, will contrast the certainty around Labour's plans with what he says is obfuscation from the Conservatives.
""Every time Theresa May and the Conservatives are asked whether they are planning tax increases if they are re-elected on 8 June, they run and hide,"" he will say.
""The Tories are hoping that the British people can be kept in the dark about what the tax increases they are planning will mean for those on middle and low incomes, who have had to bear the brunt of seven years of austerity.""
In early skirmishes over Labour's tax plans, Mr McDonnell has accused the Conservatives of telling lies.
Labour's spending commitments include recruiting 10,000 new police officers, giving NHS workers a pay rise of more than 1%, reinstating training bursaries for student nurses, bringing back the educational maintenance and carers allowances and restoring student grants.
The majority of these, it says, will be covered by the reversal of cuts to corporation, capital gains and inheritance taxes.
But its plans to boost police numbers were thrown into confusion last week when shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said in an interview that they would cost £300,000. The party later clarified that she had meant to say £300m a year by 2020.
The Conservatives are not expected to confirm their own plans until their manifesto launch later this month.
Mr Hammond was forced to abandon proposals in March's Budget to increase national insurance contributions for the self-employed following a Tory rebellion, with MPs claiming the move breached its 2015 manifesto.
During the coalition years, the focus of Conservative policy was steady increases in the personal tax allowance, the point at which people start paying income tax. The threshold rose to £11,500 last month and is due to increase to £12,000 by 2020.
After winning the 2015 election, the Conservatives also raised the level at which people start paying income tax at 40% - which has now reached £45,000 - to address the growing number of middle earners being pulled into the higher-rate bracket.
The Taxpayers Alliance campaign group said Labour's plans ""sounded good"" but there were ""gaping holes"" which could potentially allow it to increase employers' national insurance contributions and VAT on zero-rated items such as medicines.
Raising income tax for those earning more than £80,000 would require ""very significant"" changes to tax thresholds, it said.
""A better way for the parties to demonstrate they are on the side of taxpayers would be to pledge to cut the overall tax burden and leave more money in the pockets of those who earned it,"" said its chief executive John O'Connell.
For the Conservatives, Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said: ""Jeremy Corbyn will have to raise taxes because his nonsensical economic ideas don't add up and he'll make a mess of the Brexit negotiations.
The Lib Dems have pledged to put 1p on income tax to pay for increased health spending.
Treasury spokesman Susan Kramer said: ""John McDonnell has no credible plan for the future of our economy and no guarantee to employers that they won't be hit with a jobs tax.""

"Childcare application deadline looming
The deadline is imminent for parents in England to apply for 30 hours of free childcare for their three and four-year-olds for September.
It doubles the current 15 hours' allowance, with parents eligible if they both work and each earn less than Â£100,000 a year.
, and HMRC says parents who apply on that day can get a code to claim childcare.
The code should be taken to the childcare provider or local authority.
However, even if parents are eligible, they can only get the free hours if nurseries in their area can actually supply them.
Many smaller nurseries say they cannot afford to offer the free time, while others say they will restrict the number of places they can provide under the scheme.
And Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, which represents 14,000 nursery providers, told the BBC that the funding provided by the government to cover the extra hours was less than the cost of providing the childcare.
But the government says it is investing more in childcare than ever before, with ministers saying the new scheme will make a positive difference to millions of families.
There have been glitches with the Childcare Service website since mid-May, just after it was made live. Last week, Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury Committee, said it must be improved.
The website enables parents to access help with two new government-funded childcare schemes: a tax-free childcare scheme and the offer of 30 hours' free childcare for three and four-year-olds.

"Harvey Weinstein scandal: What next for Hollywood?
By Frances Cronin & Emma Saunders
Harvey Weinstein has been thanked more often than God in Oscars acceptance speeches
Oscar-winning movie producer Harvey Weinstein is at the centre of a sexual harassment scandal, which has led to him
Actress Meryl Streep - who once called him ""God"" in an awards speech - has
, saying the claims left her ""appalled"".
Dame Judi Dench, Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson are among others to have denounced him.
When the claims were first reported in the New York Times, Weinstein apologised for causing ""a lot of pain"". He later disputed the article, however, claiming the report was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"".
But it's a dramatic fall from grace for one of the movie industry's highest-profile producers, which could have wider implications for Hollywood itself.
Here are five pressing questions that arise from this mounting scandal.
What next for Harvey Weinstein?
Might Weinstein be welcomed back into the Hollywood fold like Gibson was?
The man behind such hits as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love reportedly did not want to leave The Weinstein Company - but was fired anyway.
He was apologetic but bullish last week when the allegations were first published and threatened to sue the New York Times, the paper that
Since then, he's been deserted by both his lawyer Lisa Bloom and his legal crisis adviser Lanny Davis.
It remains to be seen whether he will make good his threats of legal action.
The Weinstein Company said he was fired ""in light of new information"", so more allegations are expected to surface.
Weinstein was made an honorary CBE by the Queen in 2004 for his contribution to the British film industry, and there have already been calls for that to be revoked.
Yet there is always the possibility he can bounce back, like other disgraced Hollywood figures who have returned to the limelight.
Mel Gibson, for example, was back on Hollywood's red carpets earlier this year, despite an anti-Semitic rant during
11 years ago - although the allegations against Weinstein put him in a different situation.

Weinstein's firing comes after a number of high-profile men have left their jobs amid claims of sexual misconduct.
and Ain't It Cool News founder
. Bill Cosby is also facing a retrial over sexual assault charges.
they were ""completely unfounded claims"" and
against him as ""untrue and terribly unfair"". Knowles
""step away"" from his role.
""Men in Hollywood need to change ASAP,"" said actress Rose McGowan in an interview
""Hollywood's power is dying because society has changed and grown, and yet Hollywood male behaviour has not. It is so not a good look.""
Jenni Konner, executive producer of the HBO series Girls,
on Sunday: ""I see this as a tipping point.
""This is the moment we look back on and say, 'That's when it all started to change.'""
What next for The Weinstein Company?
The King's Speech won four Oscars in 2011
Weinstein may have been fired but an internal investigation will still go ahead. The company said it had retained an independent law firm ""to undertake a thorough and independent investigation"".
This will be a financial burden on the company, with
such investigations can cost between $20m (£15m) and $40m (£30m) to carry out. Forbes also said the company would find it more expensive to raise funds in the future.
Weinstein and his brother Bob own 42% of the company, but it's unclear how profitable the company has been in recent years.
It had started to move into TV production, but without its most famous figurehead and driving force it is unclear what will happen to any deals it has signed.
One third of the company's all-male board resigned when the allegations emerged.
that the company is set to change its name in an attempt to move on after Weinstein's firing. The website claims the Weinstein name has been ""irretrievably tainted by the scandal"", although it says a decision has not been formally made.
What does this mean for awards season?
Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner co-star in Wind River
Weinstein is renowned for his campaigning skills, often managing to turn smaller, independent films into Oscar contenders.
of nearly 1,400 Oscar acceptance speeches by the website Vocativ found that Weinstein was thanked more frequently than God.
One of his biggest hits was Shakespeare in Love, which won the best picture Oscar in 1999. A sequel has since been announced, with Weinstein as producer.
The Weinstein Company also distributed such films as The King's Speech, The English Patient and Chicago, all of which - like The Artist - won the best picture Oscar.
This year the company is pushing Wind River, a wintry thriller starring Jeremy Renner and Mary Elizabeth Olsen.
The Current War, produced by Weinstein and starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Thomas Edison, is also a possible awards contender, despite receiving mixed reviews. Will the Weinstein connection dent their chances?
What next for his political connections?
Harvey Weinstein at the 2016 Bafta Film Awards in London
The Democratic National Committee (DNC) and several Democratic politicians have come out to say they will now channel Weinstein's political donations towards women's rights groups.
The producer was a prominent donor to the Democratic Party during the 2016 election campaign.
""The DNC will donate over $30,000 (£22,850) in contributions from Weinstein to Emily's List, Emerge America and Higher Heights,"" the committee said in a statement.
There are also question marks about his other donations and interests.
In a statement issued last week, after the allegations surfaced, Weinstein said: ""One year ago, I began organising a $5m [£3.8m] foundation to give scholarships to women directors at USC [University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts].
""While this might seem coincidental, it has been in the works for a year.""
USC declined to responded when
if it would continue its connection with Weinstein.
Weinstein is also a trustee of Bafta (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) in New York and is on the board of directors at the US charity Robin Hood, which describes itself as ""New York City's largest poverty-fighting organisation"".
The BBC has contacted both organisations and is awaiting responses.

Analysis: The presidency hasn't changed Donald Trump
June 30, 2017: 10:38 AM ET
Trump tweets insults at MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski
Five months into his presidency, Donald Trump is still the same old Donald Trump.
The ""dignity of the office"" does not seem to concern him. He is distracted from immense responsibilities by personal grievances. And he still believes it is acceptable to publicly degrade women based on their physical appearance.
Even after 160 days as president, Trump has not changed his priorities or his sense of proportion when it comes to personal slights. He can not help attacking his critics in the media, even if those attacks reflect negatively on him, distract attention away from his executive and legislative efforts, and threaten his legacy.
On Thursday, in response to criticism from MSNBC co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski,
, ""I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!""
Related: Trump tweets shocking assault on Brzezinski, Scarborough
The vulgar attack, which drew criticism from Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and several Republican Senators, as well as a number of Democrats, served as a potent example of the president's temperament. Unlike his predecessors, Trump seems unconcerned with taking the moral high ground and staying above the fray. When his critics go low, the president seemed to indicate Thursday, he will go lower.
The tweets also showed how Trump's unbridled tweeting can get in the way of his own stated political ambitions. When Trump published his tweets, shortly before 9 a.m. ET, Senate Republicans were wrestling with legislation to repeal Obamacare, the House was preparing to vote on two bills likely to advance Trump's immigration agenda, and the president himself was just an hour-and-a-half away from an intelligence briefing that, given ongoing international events, was likely to focus on security concerns in Syria and North Korea.
Health care reform, immigration reform and national security were key focuses of Trump's presidential campaign, and remain areas of significant concern to Trump's supporters and Americans generally. But instead of using his powerful Twitter account to drive attention toward these issues, the president sought public revenge against cable television personalities he claims not to watch.
The justification given by deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders amounted to
""This is a president who fights fire with fire,"" she told Fox News. ""[He will not] be bullied by liberal media or liberal elites in Hollywood or anywhere else.""
Brzezinski has been an outspoken critic of Trump -- on Thursday, she called him a liar who was destroying the country -- but what confounded many politicians and members of the media was why one cable news host's criticism was the fire the president of the United States felt the need to fight, and why he felt the need to fight it with gasoline instead of water.
""Please explain how the president of the United States can be 'bullied' by the hosts of what he says it is a low-rated cable TV show?"" Fox News political analyst Brit Hume
The president's attacks on Brzezinski also served as a litmus test of what Republicans, conservative pundits and members of Trump's own family were willing to tolerate from the president in terms of his remarks about women.
House Speaker Paul Ryan called Trump's remarks inappropriate. Republican Senator Susan Collins
for ""respect and civility,"" and her colleagues Ben Sasse and Lindsey Graham said Trump's comments were beneath the dignity of his office. Even the usually pro-Trump conservative pundit Laura Ingraham
the need for ""message discipline"" from the White House.
But Trump's most loyal supporters reliably circled the wagons.
""Maybe liberal Joe should stop calling the @POTUS a schmuck, a liar, a thug and mentally unhinged,"" Fox News host Sean Hannity
. On his radio show, he called the media ""crybabies,"" even as he acknowledged Trump's tweets may not have been in his best interest.
First Lady Melania Trump, who has said she wants to make combating cyberbullying a focus of her time in the White House, was similarly supportive. ""As the First Lady has stated publicly in the past, when her husband gets attacked, he will punch back 10 times harder,"" her communications director said in a statement.
Related: 'Donald Trump is not well': Brzezinski and Scarborough respond
On Friday morning, Brzezinski and Scarborough issued their own response.
""President Trump launched personal attacks against us Thursday, but our concerns about his unmoored behavior go far beyond the personal,"" the co-hosts wrote in
. ""America's leaders and allies are asking themselves yet again whether this man is fit to be president. We have our doubts, but we are both certain that the man is not mentally equipped to continue watching our show, 'Morning Joe.'""
The pair also wrote that, earlier this year, ""top White House staff members warned that the National Enquirer was planning to publish a negative article about us unless we begged the president to have the story spiked. We ignored their desperate pleas.""
Trump hit back: ""Watched low rated @Morning_Joe for first time in long time,"" he tweeted Friday morning. ""FAKE NEWS. He called me to stop a National Enquirer article. I said no! Bad show.""

"Hair dye dangers warning for children
Children's lives could be at risk because some hairdressing salons are not following guidelines on hair dye products, BBC Wales has found.
No dye products should be used on under-16s, according to manufacturers and the industry's professional body.
was offered colouring appointments at 16 salons.
Hair dyes contain chemicals that in rare cases can cause severe, even life-threatening, allergic reactions.
Hair dye manufacturers say they are not intended for anyone under the age of 16. The European Commission insists that this warning should be put on all hair dye packaging.
The Hairdressing Federation, the profession's own body, goes further.
It tells its members that hair colour products should never be applied to anyone under the age of 16.
But when X-ray's undercover schoolgirl tested out the guidance - just one out of 17 salons acted on it, and told her she was too young.
Sammi Ford knows only too well the dangers of colouring your hair. In March, she had a severe allergic reaction to her home dye kit.
""Within half an hour my head was itching,"" she told X-ray.
""About an hour later I had a burning, itching feeling at the sides and then things got progressively worse. My eyes were so swollen I couldn't actually open them"".
Her face became covered in sores which took weeks to heal.
But the reaction could have been avoided if she had undertaken a recommended skin patch test.
It involves placing a tiny amount of the dye product on an area of uncovered skin and leaving it for 48 hours before proceeding.
Any soreness or redness would suggest an allergic reaction is likely, and using the dye should be avoided.
Manufacturers state that a patch test must be carried out, this is for home dye kits and those used by professionals in hair salons.
The hairdressers own federation goes further saying that ""allergy testing is a must for every salon"".
Donna Wallbank, who owns a salon in Brynmawr, in Blaenau Gwent said she has witnessed a growing number of her own clients having reactions to the skin test.
""We're used to normally seeing perhaps one reaction a year,"" she said.
""But since May we've seen three. It's quite scary to think, had that service been carried out without them having the skin test, what could've happened.""
Shirley Davis is an industry expert
. She said she was horrified by the results of the secret filming.
""I am absolutely appalled, they should've all said I'm sorry you're not 16, we can't do it and sent her away,"" she told X-Ray.
""Everyone within the industry is trying to professionalise it and we have salons that are actually contemplating colouring a young person's hair.
""If they did something with this young girl and she had an anaphylactic shock she could die - that's how serious it is.
""You have to patch test over-16 and under 16 it's a no-no.""
X-ray is on BBC One Wales on Monday, 30 October at 19:30 GMT, repeated on Tuesday on BBC Two Wales at 17:30,

"Stormzy stuck in ladies loo at MTV EMAs and snapchats for help
Stormzy had a good night at the MTV European Music Awards on Sunday 12 November - he won the award for best worldwide act for UK and Ireland and performed to thousands of fans at the ceremony in London.
However, it wasn't all plain sailing.
The artist accidentally went into the ladies toilet before his performance, only realising his mistake when hearing ""bare girls"" outside.
Documenting his mistake in a series of posts on Snapchat, Stormzy worried he would ""look mad creepy"" if he left the cubicle.
Luckily Stormzy's mate Kenneth was outside to help him dodge other guests and guide him to safety.
However, the escape attempt was interrupted by singer Anne Marie brushing her teeth opposite the marooned grime artist.
Unaware of Stormzy's predicament at the time, Anne Marie later found out about the saga on Twitter.

"Tracy Morgan on return to TV after accident: 'Thank God'
Updated 0107 GMT (0907 HKT) July 28, 2017
BEVERLY HILLS, CA - JULY 27: Executive producer/actor Tracy Morgan of 'The Last O.G.' at the TCA Turner Summer Press Tour 2017 Green Room at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on July 27, 2017 in Beverly Hills, California.
Tracy Morgan returns to scripted comedy in ""The Last O.G,"" but the actor feels a lot has changed since he was last on the small screen -- mainly himself.
In TBS show, Morgan stars as a man who experiences culture shock when he returns to a gentrified Brooklyn after 15 years in prison.
On the show, he's surrounded by an ensemble that includes Cedric the Entertainer, ""Girls Trip"" star
, and actor Allen Maldonado.
Asked during a panel for the series during the Television Critics Association press tour why he chose to star in a show with a strong ensemble -- versus, say, an auteur-driven comedy like those which has been popular as of late -- Morgan said he felt that wasn't the right approach.
""Maybe I'm just a better man now since the accident,"" he said, referencing a
crash that left him severely injured. ""It ain't about me. It's bigger than me.""
Morgan was in a coma for two weeks after a Walmart truck hit a limousine in which he was a passenger. Comedian James McNair, who was with Morgan, was killed in the crash.
Morgan said he takes breaks on set and is encouraged to do so by his production staff and fellow cast members.
""I have my crew and I love them and they make sure I sit down,"" he said. ""I'm taken care of by my people, and I love them with my heart.""
Following the accident, the ""30 Rock"" alum made a slow but steady return to the stage, first with a surprise appearance at the 2015 Emmy awards and then one month later as host of ""Saturday Night Live.""
A running theme in ""The Last O.G.,"" Morgan and producers said, is the importance of second chances.
Asked what it meant to him to make his return to TV in what could be viewed as his own second chance, Morgan said he had only one response: ""Thank God.""
""The Last O.G."" premieres October 24.

"Mike Ashley's Sports Direct buys 26% stake in Game Digital
Mike Ashley already owns stakes in Debenhams, French Connection and Findel
Mike Ashley's Sports Direct has bought a quarter stake in struggling computer games retailer Game Digital, adding to his list of High Street holdings.
Game said Sports Direct had bought 44 million shares, a 25.75% stake, adding that it looked forward to ""working collaboratively"" with the company.
Last month, Game issued a profit warning, blaming poor supplies of the Nintendo Switch console.
Mr Ashley has stakes in Debenhams, French Connection and Findel.
The Newcastle United owner has recently been involved in a colourful court case with an investment banker and last year was criticised for the running of a Sports Direct warehouse in Derbyshire.
In a statement Game said: ""Game is aware that Sports Direct has taken significant strategic equity stakes in a number of retail and brand businesses across both the UK and USA, and is a leading retailer which partners with major global brands and suppliers.
""The group looks forward to working collaboratively with Sports Direct to explore the clear opportunities that a constructive partnership and collaboration can deliver for all stakeholders in the gaming, live events and rapidly growing e-sports markets in which it operates.""
Broker Liberum said: ""We see a number of reasons how Game and Sports Direct can gain from a closer working relationship but it is surely the similar customer demographics that must be the key draw card here.""
Nick Bubb, retail analyst was more scathing in his assessment.
""Well, the best that can be said about the latest bizarre investment by Sports Direct is that the stake in Game Digital only cost the company about £10m, such is the low level to which the Game share price has sunk.
""How much Mike Ashley knows about the ""esports"" market remains to be seen,"" he added.
Shares in Game Digital jumped 15% on news of Sports Direct's purchase.

"What does MEPs' vote tell us about Brexit progress?
Members of the European Parliament have been voting on last week's Brexit deal during their monthly meeting in Strasbourg.
Their view is important, because MEPs will have a decisive say on the final agreement.
Here are six things we learned from their session on Wednesday.
MEPs are happy for the talks to move to the next stage
Around 80% of the European Parliament voted for the motion which said there had been enough progress in negotiating the UK and the EU's divorce that it was time to start talks about a transition period and the future relationship.
The European parliament feels that it convinced the UK to be more generous about which EU nationals get to stay in Britain after Brexit, in particular spouses, and children who have not even been born yet.
There are still concerns about the rights of EU nationals
MEPs have made this their priority issue. They are particularly worried about the application process that EU nationals will have to go through if they want to stay in the UK after Brexit.
Anti-Brexit demonstrators protested outside the UK parliament
The government says it should cost the same as a new passport - Â£72.50. Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt said it should be free so it is as accessible for a plumber as it is for a banker.
Will these be deal-breakers when the Parliament gets a formal vote on the final Brexit Agreement at the end of 2018, or will MEPs come under enormous pressure to wave it through as the clock ticks down?
David Davis a hot topic - and he was not even there
The Brexit secretary's comments that the government could change its mind about what has been agreed so far have come up a lot.
MEPs voted in favour of an amendment which said he risked undermining the good faith that has built up between both sides, and which reminded the government that they have to stick to their promises if they want to make good progress in the next phase of talks.
Is Nigel Farage preparing for ANOTHER referendum?
The former UKIP leader still chairs one of the political groups here, which gives him a prime speaking slot.
about how ""Theresa the Appeaser"" had bowed to all of the EU's demands, which he claimed would lead to continued immigration from Europe.
A future government could keep the UK in the single market too.
""I fear we will have to fight for Brexit all over again,"" he said. Is he gearing up to force a referendum on the final Brexit deal if it is too soft for his liking?
MEPs have other things to worry about
The second most talked-about-subject after Brexit was a letter sent by the President of the European Donald Tusk who chairs the summits of EU leaders.
It talked about reforms to how the EU handles asylum seekers - proof that the EU has other things on its mind, despite Brexit.
Michel Barnier looks very happy
The chief Brexit negotiator gave me a cheerful wave and his biggest smile yet.
Either sufficient progress suits him, or he loved the praise that was lavished on him by MEPs.
Alternatively, maybe he is just looking forward to some skiing back home in the French Alps, after six months of gruelling negotiations.
Theresa May 'dancing to EU's tune' over Brexit, says Farage

"Pixar's lively 'Coco' hits the right notes
Updated 1523 GMT (2323 HKT) November 20, 2017
Pixar gets back to its roots with ""Coco,"" which wraps two universal themes -- pursuing one's dreams, and how we remember loved ones -- in a colorful, culturally specific package. As the animation powerhouse has increasingly turned to the comfort of sequels, this look at the afterlife represents a lively original concept, one that powers through its flat patches with a whole lot of heart.
""Coco"" uses the Mexican Day of the Dead (or Día de los Muertos) celebration as its narrative spine, with a young boy crossing over into the Land of the Dead, where he's surrounded by outlandish skeletal figures. But the bones of the story are quite sturdy, tapping into a strong vein of emotion that recalls the cross-generational charms of movies like ""Up"" or ""Inside Out.""
Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez) has grown up in a family that shuns music because his great-great-grandfather walked out on his wife to pursue his musical ambitions. The ban is vigorously enforced by the lad's multigenerational family, which includes his ancient great-grandma, Coco, whose mind is gradually being lost to dementia, a plot point handled with sensitivity and grace.
Alas, Miguel yearns to play the guitar, so much so that in his zeal to play, he rebelliously defies his family, stealing the guitar of the revered late singer Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), a legend in their small town.
That act has surprising, magical consequences: Miguel is cast into the colorful Land of the Dead, where his late relatives are assembled, even though (thanks to their skeletal construction) everyone seems to be literally falling apart.
There, Miguel encounters Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal), who, like the other ghosts, wants to cross over to look in on the living, the twist being that these specters cease to exist when nobody is left who remembers and honors their memory.
Directed by Lee Unkrich (""Finding Nemo"") with Adrian Molina, a Pixar story artist making his directing debut, ""Coco"" is beautifully rendered, creating an alternate world that recalls the detail of ""Monsters Inc.""
The story, however, feels chaotic in stretches, and fleetingly hard to follow while laying down its elaborate rules after Miguel crosses over. Basically, he has to find an ancestor willing to provide his or her blessing and send him back to the living, only without imposing any conditions that would rob him of his dreams.
Yet if the movie at times labors during that midsection, it comes together beautifully at the end, exhibiting the sort of depth associated with Pixar's best efforts. Nor does it hurt that the film incorporates a moving song from ""Frozen"" composing team Robert Lopez and Kristin Anderson-Lopez. (As a further boost, Disney will affix the new short ""Olaf's Frozen Adventure"" to its release.)
Granted, Miguel's secret isn't as significant as Elsa's, but like many Disney protagonists, there's a commonality in his determination to be himself, even if that puts him at odds with his family. ""One cannot deny what one is meant to be,"" he's told.
The genius of Pixar's virtually unparalleled run of early hits -- before a few recent misfires and modest disappointments, like ""Cars 3"" and ""The Good Dinosaur"" -- relied on its ability to create complex children's stories, tapping into concerns associated with childhood in a manner that's as appealing to adults as kids.
""Coco"" doesn't fully scale the heights of its predecessors, but where it counts, the movie hits almost all the right notes.
""Coco"" premieres Nov. 22 in the U.S. It's rated PG.

"Grumpy Cat wins $710,000 payout in copyright lawsuit
The cat achieved popularity because of the distinctive expression it was born with
A cat made famous online because of its permanent scowl has been awarded $710,000 (Â£500,000) in a copyright case by a California federal court.
Grumpy Cat Limited sued the owners of US coffee company Grenade for exceeding an agreement over the cat's image.
The company only had rights to use the cat to sell its ""Grumppuccino"" iced drink, but sold other Grumpy products.
The cat, real name Tardar Sauce, went viral in 2012 after photographs of her sour expression emerged online.
Originally posted on the social website Reddit by the brother of the cat's owner, Tabatha Bundesen, the image of the cat quickly spread as a meme with funny text captions.
In 2013 Grenade Beverage, owned by father and son Nick and Paul Sandford, struck a $150,000 deal to market iced coffee beverages with the cat's scowl on its packaging.
End of Twitter post by @DinaJ
But in 2015 Grumpy Cat Limited sued them for breaching that contract.
, which Grumpy Cat said ""blatantly infringed"" their copyrights and trademarks.
The coffee chain's owners countersued on the grounds that the cat and its owners had not held up their side of the deal.
, according to court reports.
Grumpy Cat is thought to have earned millions in endorsement and advertising deals
They also alleged that the owners had told them Tardar Sauce was set to star in a film alongside Hollywood actors Will Ferrell and Jack Black, something that did not happen.
But a California federal jury sided with the cat and her owners, ordering the payment of $710,000 in damages for copyright and trademark infringement, as well as a $1 nominal damage fee for breach of contract.
According to Courthouse News,
but was not present for the verdict.
The famous feline was given its own animatronics likeness at San Francisco's Madame Tussauds
The cat's perpetually sad and unique expression is said to be caused by feline dwarfism and an underbite - when the lower jaw extends forward.
The six-year-old cat now has a company in her name, and a range of merchandise - including clothing, calendars and soft toys.

"Oscars 2018: Man denies stealing Frances McDormand's best actress Oscar
Terry Bryant carried an Oscar at the Governor's Ball
A man has pleaded not guilty to stealing actress Frances McDormand's Oscar after Sunday's ceremony.
McDormand was named best actress - but her statuette briefly went missing at the lavish after-show Governor's Ball.
Terry Bryant filmed himself holding a statuette and telling other guests he was a winner, before being arrested.
His lawyer Daniel Brookman said: ""There's a difference between holding an Oscar and what he is charged with, so that will play out in court.""
The 47-year-old had been in police custody on a grand theft charge, but was released without having to pay bail following Wednesday's hearing after the judge ruled he did not pose a flight risk.
Judge Deborah Brazil heard testimony from his rabbi Naomi Levy, who described him as a ""sweet, gentle man of faith"".
Ms Levy added: ""I think we are living in an unusual time in America. I believe that maybe perhaps his story is a commentary on our whole society and its obsession with its 15 minutes of fame.""
Police said Mr Bryant was a ticket holder for the Governor's Ball. He was ordered to return to court on 28 March. Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said he faces up to three years in jail if convicted.
The Oscar was retrieved and later returned to McDormand, who won for her role in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. It's the actress's second Oscar, 21 years after her first for Fargo.

"Drunk tanks may become norm, NHS boss warns 'selfish' revellers
Drunk tanks may have to become the norm in towns and cities to keep ""selfish"" revellers out of A&E, the head of the NHS in England says.
Simon Stevens said he would be closely monitoring how the mobile units cope on New Year's Eve before deciding whether they should become a regular feature.
Drunk tanks provide a safe place for those who have over-indulged to be checked over and sleep it off.
They are often used over the festive period to stop people ending up at A&E.
A number of cities have already introduced the units - also known as booze buses - all-year-round, including Newcastle, Cardiff, Manchester and Bristol.
And now Mr Stevens said he may start recommending others follow suit, given an estimated 15% of attendances at A&E are due to alcohol consumption.
This rises to about 70% on Friday and Saturday nights.
A number of cities have already introduced drunk tanks
He said he was thinking about the move after spending time with ambulance crews in London and the West Midlands in recent weeks.
""I've seen first-hand how paramedics and A&Es are being called on to deal with drunk and aggressive behaviour.""
Drunk tanks are often used over the festive period to stop people ending up at A&E
And, as the nation prepares to see in the new year, he reminded revellers to be responsible.
""When the health service is pulling out all the stops to care for sick and vulnerable patients who rightly and genuinely need our support, it's frankly selfish when ambulance paramedics and A&E nurses have to be diverted to looking after revellers who have overindulged.
""NHS doesn't stand for 'National Hangover Service',"" he added.

"'Kimmy Schmidt' stars tease new season: 'The absurdity has only been heightened'
By Topher Gauk-Roger and Jessica Iavazzi, CNN
Updated 1739 GMT (0139 HKT) May 18, 2017
'Unbreakable' cast's advice for Kimmy Schmidt
'Unbreakable' cast's advice for Kimmy Schmidt
""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" is back for another season of insane humor, high-profile cameos and a dash of music.
Ellie Kemper returns as the titular heroine, now fully engaged in life in the Big Apple after being rescued from a 15-year stint in an underground bunker. This season, Kimmy is heading to college, but that doesn't mean life will get any easier for the happy-go-lucky lead.
""The absurdity has only been heightened, and the sincerity has only been thickened,"" Kemper told CNN at the recent Season 3 premiere of the Netflix comedy.
""The more we all know each other, the deeper it gets. And that's not to say it gets less funny, because it gets very funny, but there are many more layers coming out,"" revealed co-star Carol Kane.
Expect Kimmy to find new romance in the forthcoming block of 13 episodes. ""Hamilton"" breakout Daveed Diggs guest stars as a love interest for Kimmy -- one of many famous faces who will make cameos.
Jon Hamm is back as Kimmy's imprisoned former captor. Laura Dern and Ray Liotta will also appear, but their characters are being kept under wraps. Kemper teased that Liotta's performance surprised her.
""He really is just like a little kitten. He's so sweet,"" said the actress. ""He plays a lot of bad guys so I was a little worried. And then I had to tell myself, 'Oh Ellie, he's acting when he's a bad guy!'""
Building off the show's musical success -- particularly Season 1's viral hit ""
"" -- the new season will feature some new tunes. They're not quite ready for a full musical episode yet, though, series co-creator Robert Carlock told CNN.
Jane Krakowski gets to flex her pipes.
""Did I beg? Did I plead? A little,"" Krakowski joked. ""They have given me two pretty awesome musical numbers this year. They're small, but I was thrilled to have them.""
Netflix first teased the new season with a video showing fan-favorite character Titus Andromedon (Tituss Burgess) donning his best yellow gown and baseball bat, à la Beyoncé's ""Lemonade.""
According to Burgess, filming the homage didn't come without its own set of hiccups.
""That was pretty taxing to film because I had to spend a lot of time underwater and I don't swim. So it wasn't very fun,"" explained Burgess.
The actor pulled it off with some assistance.
""I just had a bunch of lifeguards around me,"" Burgess said.
Kemper didn't appear in the Beyoncé parody, but found a connection between her character and the musician's scorned-lover opus.
""I feel like Kimmy is 'Lemonade'-ing her bunker past. That was what wronged her, and so she's sort of making that right,"" Kemper quipped.
The third season of ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" streams on Netflix beginning May 19.

"Windows 7 hardest hit by WannaCry worm
The WannaCry outbreak got started by infecting a small number of vulnerable machines
The majority of machines hit by the WannaCry ransomware worm in the cyber-attack earlier this month were running Windows 7, security firms suggest.
More than 97% of the infections seen by Kaspersky Lab and 66% of those seen by BitSight used the older software.
WannaCry started spreading in mid-May and, so far, has infected more than 200,000 computers around the world.
In the UK, some hospitals had to turn away patients as the worm shut down computer systems.
Many suggested that the reason UK hospitals suffered was because many of them still relied on programs that required Windows XP - a version of Microsoft's OS that debuted in 2001.
But infections of XP by WannaCry were ""insignificant"" said Costin Raiu from Kaspersky Lab.
Windows 7 was first released in 2009 and the most widely infected version was the x64 edition, which is widely used in large organisations, showed figures from Kasperksy.
Many organisations seem to have been caught out because they failed to apply a patch, issued by Microsoft in March. that blocked the vulnerability which WannaCry exploited.
Spanish telecoms firm Telefonica, French carmaker Renault, German rail firm Deutsche Bahn, logistics firm Fedex, Russia's interior ministry and 61 NHS organisations were all caught out by WannaCry.
After encrypting files, the WannaCry worm demanded a payment of £230 ($300) in bitcoins before they were unfrozen. So far, a reported 296 payments totalling $99,448 (£76,555) have been made to the bitcoin wallets tied to the ransomware.
There have been no reports that anyone who paid has had their data restored by the gang behind the attack.
Security experts also found that the worm spread largely by seeking out vulnerable machines on the net by itself. Before now, many thought it had got started via an email-based phishing campaign.
Adam McNeil, a senior malware analyst at Malwarebytes, said the worm was primed to look for machines vulnerable to a bug in a Microsoft technology known as the Server Message Block (SMB).
""The attackers initiated an operation to hunt down vulnerable public facing SMB ports and, once located, used the newly available SMB exploits to deploy malware and propagate to other vulnerable machines within connected networks,""
Mr McNeil said he suspected that whoever was behind the worm first identifed a ""few thousand"" vulnerable machines which were used as the launch platform for the much larger waves of infection.

"Bafta TV awards: What to look out for at this year's ceremony
Entertainment correspondent
Benedict Cumberbatch (The Hollow Crown) and Claire Foy (The Crown) are in the leading actor and actress categories
The Bafta Television awards take place on Sunday, with the lavish royal Netflix drama The Crown dominating the nominations.
The event at the Royal Festival Hall will be hosted for the first time by former Great British Bake Off presenter Sue Perkins.
Here are a few things to look out for on the big night.
Who can we expect to see on the red carpet?
The glittering guestlist includes Alan Carr, Amanda Holden, Ant and Dec, Benedict Cumberbatch, Claudia Winkleman, Daniel Mays, David Walliams, Ed Balls, Jessica Raine, Kim Cattrall, Louis Theroux, Nicola Walker, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Olivia Colman, Pearl Mackie, Sarah Lancashire, Scarlett Moffatt, Suranne Jones, Thandie Newton, Tom Hollander and Zawe Ashton.
And by the look of the seating plan (above), The Crown's Claire Foy will spend the ceremony sitting next to EastEnders' Danny Dyer.
She can tell him about Queen Elizabeth. He can tell her about the Queen Vic.
But why's Graham Norton not presenting as usual?
Sue Perkins is taking the reins this year because Norton will have been busy presenting the Eurovision Song Contest in Ukraine one day earlier.
When she was announced as host in March, Perkins
: ""Beyond chuffed to be the one keeping the inestimable @grahnort 's seat warm this year.""
Which shows have the most nominations?
BBC/Minnow Films/Joe Albas
Damilola, Our Loved Boy (BBC One) has three nominations
Damilola, Our Loved Boy - 3
What can we expect from the winning speeches?
Not just a long list of ""thank yous"" if 2016 is anything to go by.
At last year's Baftas several winners used their speeches to defend the independence of the BBC. The ceremony took place just days before the government published a white paper on the corporation's future.
This year a general election is looming.
Bafta is reported to have emailed nominees asking them to offer ""a short anecdote or an interesting detail about the production"" in their victory speeches.
, some of its recipients have dubbed it ""a ham-fisted attempt to avoid controversy"".
Will The Crown reign supreme?
Expect plenty of right royal headlines if the big budget show scoops the drama category.
The Crown's first 10 episodes launched on Netflix in November. Writer Peter Morgan intends to tell the entire story of Britain's monarchy from the reign of George VI, the Queen's father, over 60 episodes.
Claire Foy is up for leading actress for her portrayal of the young Queen Elizabeth.
Jared Harris, who plays George VI, John Lithgow (Winston Churchill) and Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret) are all nominated for their supporting roles.
Last year Bafta changed its rules on eligibility which has allowed shows with international funding, such as The Crown, to be entered outside the international category.
The best actress race is one to watch
Leading actress nominees (clockwise from top left) Claire Foy, Sarah Lancashire, Nikki Amuka-Bird and Jodie Comer
This is Claire Foy's second consecutive nomination for lead actress. Last year she was nominated for her role as Anne Boleyn in Wolf Hall, but lost out to Doctor Foster actress Suranne Jones.
This year's competition is just as tough.
She's up against NW's Nikki Amuka-Bird, Happy Valley's Sarah Lancashire and Jodie Comer for BBC Three abduction drama Thirteen.
Could streaming services win big?
The cast of Netflix's Stranger Things
Yes, we're talking about those shows that weren't made for the traditional broadcast channels.
Netflix has never won a TV Bafta, so victory for The Crown would be a big deal.
It has another shot at glory with sci-fi hit Stranger Things, a strong contender in the international category.
Last year that category went to Netflix rival Transparent, on Amazon Prime, about a Los Angeles family who discover that their retired father is a transgender woman.
And who did it beat? Netflix's Narcos, among others. Ouch.
Transparent is nominated again this year - but there's also stiff competition from HBO's crime drama The Night Of and the Golden Globe-winning The People v O J Simpson: American Crime Story.
And let's not forget all the nominees from online-only channel BBC Three.
Will the stars of Fleabag be jumping for joy?
Phoebe Waller-Bridge is up for best female comedy performance
Talking of BBC Three, its breakout comedy hit Fleabag has three nominations.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who adapted her own one-woman theatre show, plays a sarcastic, sex-obsessed young woman attempting to navigate modern life in London.
Fleabag is nominated for best scripted comedy, while Waller-Bridge and Fleabag co-star Olivia Colman are up against each other for female comedy performance.
They are up against Lesley Manville for Mum and Diane Morgan for Cunk on Shakespeare.
Joanna Lumley won't be going home empty-handed
It's already been announced that the Ab Fab star is being honoured with the prestigious Bafta Fellowship.
Perhaps best known for playing champagne-sipping Patsy Stone, Lumley has had one of the most varied careers in British entertainment.
After starting out as a model she was propelled to fame in the 1970s as Purdey in The New Avengers.
She once took 27 takes to kiss Leonardo DiCaprio when they were filming a scene for The Wolf of Wall Street.
Surely that deserves a Bafta all of its own.
When can I watch the ceremony?
The Virgin TV British Academy Television Awards will be broadcast on BBC One on Sunday at 20:00 BST.

"BBC's Antiques Roadshow to review ivory objects policy
The BBC said the Antiques Roadshow, presented by Fiona Bruce, rarely shows ivory items
The BBC is to review its policy of allowing objects made of ivory to appear on the Antiques Roadshow.
The programme has faced criticism from wildlife campaigner Virginia McKenna, who said it presented ivory as a thing of beauty, not a symbol of destruction.

The BBC said it sought to raise awareness of the ""horrors"" of poaching.

She said she was a regular viewer of the Antiques Roadshow, which she accused of continuing to represent ivory as a ""desirable item, a thing of beauty instead of a symbol of destruction"".
She added: ""We cannot afford to put a value on bloody ivory.""
Virginia McKenna said the show's inclusion of ivory was ""out of touch"" with public opinion
A spokeswoman for the BBC said ivory items rarely featured on the Antiques Roadshow.
""In recent years, on the rare occasions when we have examined an object, the Antiques Roadshow has sought to raise awareness of the debate around antique ivory,"" she said.
She said the programme would inform viewers about current legislation and draw attention to the ""horrors of modern-day poaching"".

"Bags for life can pose food poisoning risk, says Food Standards Agency
Bags for life pose a food poisoning risk if they are used to carry raw foods such as meat and fish, a consumer watchdog is warning.
The Food Standards Agency says even if there is no leakage, packaging can harbour traces of harmful bacteria that can cause stomach bugs.
Shoppers should have separate bags for raw foods, ready-to-eat foods and household items such as detergent.
Reusable bags could be colour coded or labelled to avoid any mix-up, it says.
If there has been visible spillage, soiling or damage, plastic bags for life should be replaced, while fabric ones could be washed or cleaned.
""Even if there are no obvious spillages or staining after several uses, we would recommend that cotton/fabric bags for life be machine-washed regularly if they have been used for carrying raw items,"" the FSA website recommends in an updated post.
Although instances are rare, shop-bought chicken is a potential source of infection.
Tests by the FSA have shown chicken packaging can carry a bug called campylobacter - the most common cause of food poisoning in the UK.
Campylobacter poisoning usually develops a few days after eating contaminated food and leads to symptoms that include abdominal pain, severe diarrhoea and, sometimes, vomiting.
Eggs, fish and loose vegetables with soil on can also pose a food poisoning risk, says the FSA website.
Large shops in England have been charging 5p for single-use plastic carrier bags for nearly two years.
However, they are not required to charge for plastic bags for certain products - including uncooked fish, meat or poultry products.
Carrier bag charges were introduced in Wales in 2011, in Northern Ireland in 2013 and in Scotland three years ago.

"Diane Abbott: Listen to CBI and NHS' on Brexit migration
Public services and businesses would be in a ""terrible position"" if there was a big reduction in migration post-Brexit, Labour's Diane Abbott has told the BBC.
The shadow home secretary said the CBI, health and social care say ""they need these European migrants - and we have to listen to them"".
Labour voters were concerned about ""the chaos"" of Brexit negotiations rather than freedom of movement, she said.
Migration was a key issue during the EU referendum campaign.
Ms Abbott was asked on the Andrew Marr show about her front bench colleague Sir Keir Starmer's interview last week, in which he agreed that Labour backed ""easy movement"" of workers after it had left the EU's single market.
She said ""most people agree"" that some of the bureaucracy around migration had to be reduced.
""I think that's what we were referencing when we talked about easy movement - less bureaucracy; it's good for migrants but it's also good for business"".
Asked whether EU nationals would need visas to work in the UK under a Labour government, she replied: ""We will have to see how this negotiation goes.""
She said there would be ""fair rules and a reasonable management of migration"" after Brexit if Labour were in power, to replace freedom of movement, which ends when the UK leaves the EU's single market.
Asked if she expected the number of EU migrants would reduce after Brexit under Labour, she said: ""The health service, they're very worried about a collapse in the number of EU migrants coming here.
""Social care would be in a terrible position.... finance, education, so we will be listening, as the government should be listening, to what business and the public sector says about its needs for labour.
""The reality is that business, the CBI, the Institute of Directors, but also health, education and social care; they say that they need these European migrants and we have to listen to them.""
Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis told BBC Radio 5live's Pienaar's Politics that the government had commissioned work on the impact of EU labour on the British economy with the aim of ensuring business could access the skills needed - and improving the skills of British workers.
He said the UK needed to both ""get control of our borders"" and improve skills.
But he said that while immigration had been a key issue in the Leave vote, people understood that a Brexit deal had to be reached ""that doesn't damage our economy"".
The Conservatives' aim since 2010 has been to reduce net migration to below 100,000. Neither Prime Minister Theresa May nor her predecessor, David Cameron, have come close to meeting that target.
The Office for National Statistics reported last month that net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third to 230,000 in the year to June 2017. In this 12-month period, 572,000 people arrived in the UK, and 342,000 emigrated.
Immigration specifically fell by 80,000 people over the year - and three-quarters of that drop was down to fewer EU citizens coming to live in the UK, figures showed

"Grenfell fire: MP calls for inquiry chairman to quit
The judge heading the Grenfell Tower inquiry has been urged to stand down by the local MP for Kensington, who says they need ""somebody we can trust"".
This follows a call on Monday for Sir Martin Moore-Bick to quit by lawyers representing some of the victims.
Labour MP Emma Dent Coad said Sir Martin was ""a technocrat"" who lacked ""credibility"" with the families.
Retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Martin has said he understands the ""desire of local people for justice"".
It comes as questions are raised over the efforts being made to rehouse those left homeless by the fire on 14 June.
At least 80 people are thought to have died in the Grenfell Tower fire in North Kensington, west London.
The final toll may not be known until the end of the year, say police.
Ms Dent Coad said: ""I have been talking to hundreds of people who have been affected.
""They need somebody they can talk to, somebody with a bit of a human face,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
""I don't think he should do it. I don't think there will be any credibility.
""Some people are saying they are not going to co-operate with it, so it's not going to work.""
There has been widespread criticism of Sir Martin following his appointment.
Local residents have questioned whether his background in commercial law was appropriate.
They have also been angered by his decision to allow Kensington Council - who was criticised for its slow and ineffective response to the disaster - to contribute to the inquiry.

"Macronomy: What are Emmanuel Macron's economic plans?
Mr Macron campaigned on a pro-EU platform
With Emmanuel Macron's French election win, the prospect of France leaving the European Union - as proposed by his run-off opponent Marine le Pen - has been all but eliminated.
But many analysts are already saying that if Mr Macron fails to deliver on economic promises over the next five years, then the challenge from the National Front could be even stiffer come the 2022 election.
As a former economy minister to outgoing president Francois Hollande, his economic credentials formed a big part of his campaign.
So what are some of his key economic policies?
The election result briefly sent the euro to a six-month high against the dollar, as markets reacted to the victory by the pro-EU candidate. Ms le Pen had campaigned for France to leave the euro and proposed a referendum in which French voters would have an opportunity to vote to leave the EU.
Mr Macron wants France to stay in the eurozone, but reform it. In his manifesto, he wanted a common eurozone budget and a eurozone finance minister too.
He also will ask Berlin to invest and spend more to help Germany's domestic economy, which it is hoped will help French exporters and manufacturers in other European countries.
But all of this can only happen with Germany's backing. There'll be no decisions until after Germany's elections later this year, so for now he can only focus on domestic policy.
While Francois Hollande initially tried to please the socialist elements of his party by being tough on companies, Mr Macron as economy minister oversaw a change in direction over the past three years, heralding a more pro-business approach.
That included about 40bn euros ($44bn; Â£33.9bn) in tax breaks to try to invigorate the economy, a benefit Mr Macron plans to make permanent.
He also says corporation tax will gradually reduce from 33% to 25%.
And a new wealth tax, aimed at the rich, will not apply to financial investments.
in France is 10.1%. About three million people who want to work and are looking for a job don't have one.
While not the worst figures in Europe, it is above average for the region and far worse than, for example, the Netherlands, where it is just above 5%, and Germany, where it is below 4%. The figure for the UK is below 5%.
Youth unemployment is particularly bad, with about one in four under-25s out of work.
France's unemployment rate is currently 10%
Mr Macron has said he hopes to get unemployment down by thinning some of the labour laws, with an aim of making it less onerous on employers to take on new staff.
The International Monetary Fund
that it will be hard to get French unemployment down much below 8.5% without major reform.
But one thing in the President-elect's favour is that the strongest union in the private sector is now the moderate CFDT, which now has more clout than the more militant CGT.
Mr Macron has no plans to scrap France's controversial 35-hour working week - a rule which doesn't ban long hours, but is a threshold which triggers overtime payment. Instead he has said he'll allow firms to negotiate deals with their staff on hours and pay.
And perhaps another sign of hope. The economy has been creating jobs at the fastest pace in more than a decade.
The European Union requires members to make sure their budget deficit (essentially the difference between what it brings in through revenues e.g. tax and what it spends) is no more than 3% of gross domestic product.
France has missed this target - at times dramatically - in recent years as the Hollande government resisted pressure to bring in swingeing austerity measures.
Mr Macron says that as economy minister he was working towards hitting that target, and estimates it'll happen this year.
France has one of the largest public sectors in the world. Public spending last year was 56.5% of GDP.
And with plans to reduce corporation tax, cutting that spending bill becomes more urgent.
Mr Macron believes he can save 60bn euros over five years. This is not hugely radical, for example election rival Francois Fillon had proposed 100bn euros of spending cuts.
One concrete measure we know about is plans to cut about 120,000 government jobs by not replacing civil servants when they retire.
However, he also wants to make unemployment benefits available to groups currently not eligible, including the self-employed, entrepreneurs and farmers.
And while other European countries look to force people to work longer before being entitled to state pensions, France's official retirement age of 62 will be unchanged. The president-elect does, however, have plans to overhaul the system to make pension payouts more closely tied to what individuals pay in.

"The Mexican doctor rehydrating the dead
In the 1990s, Ciudad Juarez became infamous for the number of women killed there
Warning: This article contains images that readers might find disturbing.
Rosa María Apodaca has spent the past six years looking for her eldest daughter.
Patricia Jazmín Ibarra was 18 when she left on the morning of 7 June 2011 to go to work at a mobile phone shop in the centre of Ciudad Juárez.
""They stole her,"" says her mother, who has given up her job to look for Patricia Jazmín.
Ms Apodaca knows that many of the young girls who disappeared from Ciudad Juárez were eventually found dead.
The city on the Mexican-US border is located on a key route for drug smuggling and human trafficking.
In the 1990s, Ciudad Juárez became infamous for the staggering numbers of young women who disappeared from it, and between 2008 and 2011 the city held the dubious title of murder capital of the world.
""They never find them alive. They find only bones, this is how they give them back to their families,"" Ms Apodaca says of the many women who have gone missing.
""You never have the certainty that it is your own daughter.""
It is people like Ms Apodaca that Dr Alejandro Hernández Cárdenas is trying to help.
He works as a forensic doctor at the prosecutor's office and has developed a special technique to rehydrate corpses in order to help identify them.
Dr Alejandro Hernández Cárdenas has invented a formula for the rehydration of bodies
The technique is so innovative that last year the Mexican Institute for Industrial Property gave him a patent for his secret formula.
Forensic experts have used glycerine injections to reconstitute fingers to get prints for over a century. But that technique does not work for entire bodies.
If the bodies can be rehydrated enough to allow for fingerprinting, identification becomes easier
DNA testing can help, but in order to identify bodies, samples from two direct family members are needed for comparison.
With the rehydration process, the body can regain most of its original condition so families can identify it.
""I think I am doing this work because I was affected by the idea of these bodies going to mass graves or their families not being able to mourn properly,"" Dr Hernández says.
The rehydration technique has also helped provide key leads in criminal investigations.
When Dr Hernández rehydrated a corpse in the state of Queretaro, in central Mexico, he discovered unusual lesions on its skin, which later led to an arrest being made.
Rehydration sometimes reveals tattoos or other unique characteristics
The doctor was told that his help was key in bringing the murderer to justice.
Dr Hernández, 59, says that he first thought of becoming a forensic expert when he was 18 and studying to be a dentist while also driving an ambulance to help provide for his young family.
One night in 1977, he was called out to a train accident that had killed 35 people and had left most of the victims unrecognisable.
""When the forensic doctor arrived, he told us to check their teeth,"" Dr Hernández recalls.
He helped out at the morgue for four or five days, while the victims' families were waiting for news outside.
While the task may seem gruesome to some, it inspired in Dr Hernández a desire to help identify victims of crime.
Pig skin and human fingers
After becoming a dentist and eventually joining the forensic lab, he started experimenting with his rehydration technique.
Dr Hernández has made it his mission to try and identify bodies which otherwise may end up in mass graves without a name
He often has little to go on, such as a piece of desiccated skin
He used pig skin and human fingers he kept in glass jars and checked on them daily.
One day in 2004 he was inspecting seven jars. When he took out the finger from the fourth jar, it looked perfect.
""It was like a new finger. I couldn't believe it,"" he says.
At first he thought it was too good to be true and suspected his colleagues of playing a trick on him. But when he confronted them, one told him: ""We don't mess with them, they smell too bad.""
He had found the magic formula and four years later managed to rehydrate a full corpse.
In recent years, Dr Hernández has been applying his technique more and more to migrants found dead in the border area.
Posters of missing people are a common sight in Ciudad Juárez
Ciudad Juárez is one of the main crossing points to the US. More than 6,000 bodies have been recovered from along the border since the 1990s.
The bodies are often found in mass graves and are often hard to identify because they have been mutilated or are mummified because of the harsh weather conditions.
Because there is no investigation unit at the forensic lab where he works, Dr Hernández has been financing his research himself, paying for the chemicals and working on it in his spare time.
He hopes that someone will take an interest in his research but ultimately wishes for less, rather than more, work. ""It's not that I am lazy, it's just that when I have a lot of work it means that a lot of people have died,"" he explains.
""I would prefer not to have found this formula - if it meant that those people had never died.""

"Google removes cupcake calorie counter from Maps
Some users did not want to be told how many cakes they had walked
Google has decided to remove an update to Maps that shows users how many calories they would burn if they walked to their destination.
It follows what the search giant described as ""strong user feedback"" with many criticising the feature as patronising, shaming and a possible trigger for eating disorders.
The pink cupcake calorie counter was also lambasted as being unscientific.
It will be removed by the end of the day, Google has confirmed.
The experimental feature was rolled out on the iOS version of Google Maps, beneath walking directions.
It told people how many calories they would burn if they walked and what that was in terms of cupcakes.
Just noticed that Google Maps tells you the number of mini cupcakes you'll burn on your walk. Not sure I want this info,esp after a workout
— Sandhya Kambhampati (@sandhya__k)
End of Twitter post by @sandhya__k
Twitter user Taylor Lorenz summed up the attitude of many when she tweeted that the feature could be ""extremely triggering"" for someone with eating disorders.
She also criticised it because it could not be turned off, and for being ""wildly inaccurate"" because it failed to take into account general health information.
Do they realize how extremely triggering something like this is for ppl who have had eating disorders? Not to mention just generally shamey

Also these ""calorie estimates"" take nothing about you or ur health into account so they're just wildly inaccurate and useless in general imo

Priya Tew, a member of the Association of UK Dietitians said: ""Although it is good to encourage people to walk more, having the calories used on Google Maps does not seem to be the best way to do this.
""Firstly it encourages competition, trying to burn more calories each day which could be triggering for some people who have a tendency to over-exercise. Secondly it could make people feel shamed that they have not walked far enough or burned enough calories.
""If people want to count their calories then they should be given the option to do this, rather than it being enforced.""

"Wi-fi security flaw 'puts devices at risk of hacks'
Most wi-fi devices could be at risk
The wi-fi connections of businesses and homes around the world are at risk, according to researchers who have revealed a major flaw dubbed Krack.
It concerns an authentication system which is widely used to secure wireless connections.
Experts said it could leave ""the majority"" of connections at risk until they are patched.
The researchers added the attack method was ""exceptionally devastating"" for Android 6.0 or above and Linux.
A Google spokesperson said: ""We're aware of the issue, and we will be patching any affected devices in the coming weeks.""
The US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (Cert) has issued a warning on the flaw.
""US-Cert has become aware of several key management vulnerabilities in the four-way handshake of wi-fi protected access II (WPA2) security protocol,"" it said.
""Most or all correct implementations of the standard will be affected.""
Computer security expert from the University of Surrey Prof Alan Woodward said: ""This is a flaw in the standard, so potentially there is a high risk to every single wi-fi connection out there, corporate and domestic.
""The risk will depend on a number of factors including the time it takes to launch an attack and whether you need to be connected to the network to launch one, but the paper suggests that an attack is relatively easy to launch.
""It will leave the majority of wi-fi connections at risk until vendors of routers can issue patches.""
The vulnerability was discovered by researchers led by Mathy Vanhoef, from Belgian university, KU Leuven.
According to his paper, the issue centres around a system of random number generation known as nonce (a number that can only be used once), which can in fact be reused to allow an attacker to enter a network and snoop on the data being sent in it.
""All protected wi-fi networks use the four-way handshake to generate a fresh session key and so far this 14-year-old handshake has remained free from attacks,
describing Krack (key reinstallation attacks).
""Every wi-fi device is vulnerable to some variants of our attacks. Our attack is exceptionally devastating against Android 6.0: it forces the client into using a predictable all-zero encryption key.""
Dr Steven Murdoch from University College, London said there were two mitigating factors to what he agreed was a ""huge vulnerability"".
""The attacker has to be physically nearby and if there is encryption on the web browser, it is harder to exploit.""
More details can be found at
Prof Alan Woodward explained the issue to the BBC.
When any device uses wi-fi to connect to, say, a router it does what is known as a ""handshake"": it goes through a four-step dialogue, whereby the two devices agree a key to use to secure the data being passed (a ""session key"").
This attack begins by tricking a victim into reinstalling the live key by replaying a modified version of the original handshake. In doing this a number of important set-up values can be reset which can, for example, render certain elements of the encryption much weaker.
This attacks appears to work on all wi-fis tested - prior to the patches currently being issued.
In some it is possible to decrypt and inject data, enabling an attacker to hijack a connection. In others it is even worse as it is possible to forge a connection, which, as the researchers note, is ""catastrophic"".
The people this could be most problematic for are the internet service providers who have millions of routers in customers' homes. How will they make sure all of them are secure?

"Mother wins MoD apology over 'Snatch' Land Rover death
Legal correspondent, BBC News
Pte Phillip Hewett, of the Staffordshire Regiment, was killed on 16 July, 2005
In July 2005, Sue Smith's son, Pte Phillip Hewett, was killed by a roadside bomb while travelling in a lightly armoured ""snatch"" Land Rover in Iraq.
He was the ninth of 37 service personnel to be killed in the vehicles in Iraq and Afghanistan, which came to be known as ""mobile coffins"".
Twelve years later, following a legal battle that reached the Supreme Court, Sue has finally got her apology.
""He didn't die for nothing,"" she says.
Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Sue has recalled her journey from the inquest process, to a victory at the Supreme Court, to the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War.
It has resulted in a settlement of her case and an apology from Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon for failures that ""could have saved lives"".
Sue remembered how Phillip had become worried about travelling in the Snatch.
""He wrote to his uncle saying that he was concerned that so many of his friends had lost their driving licences so they didn't have to drive in Iraq.
""One of his friends said, 'It's better to be judged by 12 than carried by six,' because that's how dangerous the vehicles were. But he wouldn't have refused. He would have done as he was told.""
Sue, from Tamworth in Staffordshire, said that when Phillip, a fitness fanatic, came home on leave, he was a shadow of his former self.
""He spoke to his sisters and discussed his funeral and said what he wanted. He wasn't the same. His character was different.
""He wouldn't tell me. I think he was trying to protect me so I didn't worry. But I was worrying anyway. Had I known, I think I would have run over his foot or something to stop him having to go back.""
The day Phillip died, Sue had a premonition.
""I got up to go to work and there was a breaking news story about three soldiers from the Staffordshire battle group that had been killed in Al Amarah by a roadside bomb.
""I can't explain it but I just knew before I went out the door. And we were sorting out his birthday presents to send to him. It's like something inside me. I can't really explain it better than that.""
Sue recalled that waiting for the body to be repatriated was the worst time, because no-one would tell her what had happened.
The inquest into Phillip's death was due to last five days and Sue hoped it would provide answers, but it was completed in three hours.
""Quite honestly it was like a smack in the face. It was almost as if those three lives were worth an hour each. It shocked me that it was so dismissive.
""Because by then I knew that (the vehicle) was what had to be questioned,"" she said.
""And it was almost like I was something under someone's foot and they just wanted to get rid of me, and it made me feel more determined because I knew there was more to be answered than what I got at the inquest.""
Sue Smith (pictured third from the right) at a Stop the War Coalition march in London in September, 2005
Desperate for answers about the Snatch, Sue founded a group called the Military Families Support Group with other families of service personnel.
She was initially told by the MoD that the people in a position to decide, had decided that the Snatch was the correct vehicle for the job.
She found the inability to get answers from the MoD maddening.
""Sometimes I felt like they just wanted me to go away or die,"" she said.
But after yet another death things changed and armoured personnel carriers (APCs) were deployed on the same roads in Iraq that had been deemed too narrow for them prior to Phillip's death.
Sue decided that the only really effective way to try and get answers was legal action.
Sue Smith after the ruling in her favour at the Supreme Court in 2013
In June 2013 she and the families of two other soldiers, Pte Lee Ellis and L/Cpl Kirk Redpath, killed in Snatch Land Rovers
It gave them the right to sue the MoD under the Human Rights Act because it was deemed the soldiers were within the UK's jurisdiction at the time of their deaths, and so were subject to human rights law. The MoD had wanted to strike their claims out.
Sue recalled: ""I was really, really happy that at last, soldiers had got the right to life, and they had to make things right, and yet I suppose it was a bitter-sweet moment, because I did it for Phillip because I didn't want his death to be for nothing.""
Even after the Supreme Court case, the MoD continued to contest her case.
into the inquiry into the Iraq War by Sir John Chilcot in July 2016 that changed everything.
Sue had been to see the inquiry team and was instrumental in it considering the Snatch deaths. The report's criticisms were stark.
The MoD had known about the vehicle's vulnerability and for years had failed to provide more heavily armoured vehicles.
Sue believes that if the MoD had listened to her earlier, the lives of some of the 37 soldiers could have been saved.
But even after Chilcot, Sue's solicitor Jocelyn Cockburn, from the firm Hodge, Jones and Allen, was frustrated by the MoD.
""It was clear that Chilcot had been provided with the very information about Snatch Land Rovers which we'd been asking for all those years - and which we'd been told was not available, was too difficult to provide,"" she said.
Finally, Sue's case and that brought by the families of Pte Ellis and L/Cpl Redpath have been settled, and each has received a letter of apology from the defence secretary.
In the one written to Sue and seen by the BBC, Sir Michael expresses his regret at Phillip's death.
""I am fully aware of the struggle you have had to bring this matter to court over the last decade and I recognise that this has had a significant impact on you and your family,"" he writes.
""The government entirely accepts the findings of Sir John Chilcot in the Iraq Inquiry in relation to Snatch Land Rover.
""I would like to express directly to you my deepest sympathies and apologise for the delay, resulting in decisions taken at the time in bringing into service alternative protected vehicles which could have saved lives.""
He goes on to say that lessons have been learnt, and ends: ""The government must and will ensure that our armed forces are always properly equipped and resourced.""
Sue said the apology was ""bitter sweet"".
Her 12-year legal battle has taken a heavy toll on her and her family, but she feels that Phillip's death now leaves a legacy.
""I'd like it to be that his death made a difference. He's not just a casualty of Iraq.
""Iraq is almost forgotten now. It's almost Britain's Vietnam. People don't want to remember. But at least at the end of it, it's worth it. Not his death, but for people to remember what I've done in his name.""

"How Bradley Walsh proved his careers officer wrong
Bradley Walsh: ""I actually didn't start singing until I was 26.""
""Absolutely true,"" says Bradley Walsh. ""That's absolutely true.
""Absolutely true. Absolutely true. Ab-so-lutely true.""
The thing that is true (and absolutely true, at that) is an anecdote Walsh tells in the song You Know Best from his new album, When You're Smiling.
It goes back to his school days in Watford, when the star was sent to see his deputy headmaster for a bit of careers advice.
""All I ever wanted to do was play football,"" he explains. ""I was never one for revising and I only left school with three O Levels.
""At this point, I was playing for the county at football and I'd been spotted by a couple of clubs. But he said, 'You can't put all your eggs in one basket, Bradley. You have to think about what you're going to do for a living. A
""I said, 'If I don't play football for a living, I'm going to get into showbusiness.'
""He went, 'Don't be ridiculous. What as?' And I said, 'Well, I'm going to be a comedian'.
""He just looked at me and laughed.
""And I said, 'See? I'm good!'""
The star played Coronation Street's Danny Baldwin for two years
Of course, Bradley Walsh had the last laugh, literally.
He not only became a professional footballer
a stand-up comedian, but he's also been a Pontins Bluecoat, the boss of Coronation Street's knicker factory, the star of Law & Order: UK, host of Tonight at the London Palladium, Dick Whittington in panto, and quizmaster on ITV game show The Chase.
Next year, he'll be the companion to Jodie Whittaker's Doctor (but he's not allowed to talk about that yet).
Oh, and he had the biggest selling debut album by a British artist in 2016.
Yes, you read that right. Chasing Dreams, a collection of big band tunes and swing standards, outsold the likes of Zayn Malik, Jack Garratt and Blossoms - becoming the only debut album to win a gold disc last year.
""I'm not sure exactly how that works, but there you are,"" he says.
Walsh will co-star with Mandip Gill, Jodie Whittaker and Tosin Cole in the next series of Doctor Who
Walsh pulled off the feat by selling actual CDs in an era when most listening happens on streaming services.
Walsh, who achieved just 357 ""sales"" from streams, acknowledges his success comes from appealing to ""a certain age bracket"" who still buy albums.
""I haven't got a problem with that at all,"" he says. ""It just shows you there's a market.""
BBC News last bumped into Walsh at the Brit Awards in February.
""I'm sitting on Sony Music's table tonight, so I'm going to find out if I get a second album,"" he told us at the time.
It must have been an interesting discussion. Walsh, who had just been given a
, declared: ""I'm now going to release a grime album. That is what I'm going to do!""
Sony eventually talked him down from what could have been 2017's most misguided record, persuading the star that a second collection of cruise ship standards was a safer bet.
Walsh struck up a friendship with Stormzy at the Brit Awards
The result is When You're Smiling - which contains avuncular versions of The Good Life and Come Fly With Me alongside more personal selections such as Maybe This Time, from the film Cabaret, and Tony Bennett's When Do The Bells Ring For Me?
Walsh says that, while Sony insisted on certain ""greatest hits"", he picked songs ""I could really get my teeth into as an actor"".
""If you can get that, if you can tell the story, half the time you don't have to have the most fantastic voice,"" he explains.
Walsh's ability to inhabit the character of a song pays dividends on his version of One For My Baby (And One More For The Road).
Originally recorded by Fred Astaire, it finds the singer spilling his guts to a barman - ""
Set 'em up Joe, I got a little story
"" - after his relationship collapses.
Walsh approaches the song like a confession, leaning in to the microphone and almost whispering the melody.
""It's really intimate,"" he says. ""I'm hardly singing, in actual fact.""
""It's an album of torch songs for guys,"" says Walsh of his latest record
Walsh says he took similar care over the song's arrangement.
""The opening line of the song is, '
It's a quarter to three, there's no-one in the place except you and me,
' but, deliberately, we put on the background noise of people in the bar.
""He's in such a bad state that, no matter how many people are in the bar, it's only him and the barman talking.""
At the other end of the performance scale is Get Happy, ""which is an exhausting song to sing"".
""It's almost 75 key changes!"" grimaces the star. ""After the first time we did it, I was bending over with my hands on my knees to catch my breath. It's absolutely knackering.""
After all that effort, does he think the new album can match the performance of his debut?
""Obviously I would love it to sell. It's worthy of selling,"" he says.
""But ultimately all I want people to do is to sit at home, put it on, and think, 'Wow, this is great'.""
Including, presumably, his old careers officer.
When You're Smiling is out now on Sony Records.

"Blac Chyna sues Kardashian family
Blac Chyna says the Kardashians sabotaged her television series
Blac Chyna is suing the Kardashian family, alleging they are to blame for the axing of her reality TV show.
She claims the ""vindictive"" family wants to destroy her.
Blac Chyna's attorney confirmed to the BBC that Kris Jenner is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, along with Kourtney, Kim and Khloe Kardashian and Kendall and Kylie Jenner.
It follows the break-up of Blac Chyna's relationship with Rob Kardashian, during which time they had a daughter.
Rob Kardashian with Blac Chyna in 2016
The 29-year-old is alleging she suffered assault, battery, domestic violence and harassment at the hands of her ex-fiance.
The court documents filed against the Kardashians and published in full by
, allege Rob Kardashian is an ""abuser intent on destroying Angela White [Blac Chyna's real name].""
The papers also accuse the Kardashians of using their fame, wealth and power to exact revenge on her, ""slut-shaming"" her and sabotaging the recommissioning of her own reality TV show
Sisters Kim and Kourtney Kardashian are accused of ""slut-shaming"" Blac Chyna
The move comes two weeks after Rob Kardashian filed his own lawsuit saying it was she who attacked him - a claim Blac Chyna denies.
Lisa Bloom, who is Blac Chyna's attorney, told the BBC that the idea Rob Kardashian - who is over a foot taller than his former fiancee - ""would be in fear of her, is silly"".
Rob also accuses Blac Chyna of using him as well as his family for financial gain and said it was a mutual decision by the E! Network and the Kardashian family to cancel the show.
, E! sources say they have emails to prove that the production team were questioning the future of the show due to the fact Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian could not be in the same room together.
Blac Chyna says they had already started shooting the second series of Rob & Chyna and claims the Kardashians wanted to ""kill"" the series.
L-R: Kris Jenner, Lamar Odom, Khloe Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, North West, and Kourtney Kardashian
She cites one episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians in which the family discuss whether the show should be axed, saying the series had ""bad, unhealthy energy"".
Bloom said Blac Chyna would be seeking damages for not only the loss of her reality TV series, but the accompanying endorsements that would have gone with it.
She says her client has lost out on ""many many millions"" of dollars.
A representative acting on behalf of the Kardashians was unavailable to respond to the allegations.

"DoJ narrows Trump protesters data demand
Large protests were held in Washington DC on 20 January, the day of President Trump's inauguration
Visitors to an anti-Trump website will probably not have their internet protocol addresses turned over to the Department of Justice, after a legal standoff with a US web company.
DreamHost had argued the DoJ's warrant would have revealed 1.3 million IP addresses.
The DoJ has now narrowed the scope of its demand.
Disruptj20.org was set up to help arrange a protest at President Trump's inauguration.
""The government has no interest in records relating to the 1.3 million IP addresses that are mentioned in DreamHost's numerous press releases and opposition briefs,"" prosecutors said in the new request.
They were focused on the use of the website to plan and carry out a criminal act - a ""riot"" - not the ""lawful activities of peaceful protesters"", they said.
The warrant does not now require certain access and error logs, which, DreamHost says, means visitors' IP addresses are ""largely safe"".
""We see this as a huge win for internet privacy, and we absolutely appreciate the DoJ's willingness to look at and reconsider both the scope and the depth of their original request for records,"" DreamHost said
However, it still plans to challenge the DoJ on other aspects of its request.
Prosecutors signed the original warrant to DreamHost in July, arguing that disruptj20.org had been used to organise ""violent"" protests in Washington DC.
DreamHost and privacy advocates argued that
In its updated warrant, the DoJ said that the full scope of the original request - criticised by DreamHost in its public statements - had been ""unknown to the government and the court at the time that the warrant was issued"".
Data still required by the amended warrant includes files and databases stored by DreamHost.
More than 200 people have been charged in relation to rioting at the inauguration.

"Big thaw leaves thousands without water in parts of UK
One restaurant owner in London was left without water on Sunday
Homes across the UK are facing water supply problems - with thousands of people in Wales and south-east England urged to use as little as possible.
Water suppliers say a weather thaw has led to burst water mains and leaks.
About 5,000 homes are without water in Kent, thousands of properties are affected in Wales, while about 12,000 homes in London lost water overnight.
In south-east England, water firms have been identifying vulnerable customers and providing them with bottled water.
Parts of the Midlands and Scotland are also affected by intermittent supply.
Increased demand on Monday morning has put pressure on many water networks, with suppliers warning of poor water pressure and intermittent supplies as they try to refill pipes.
Thames Water have been handing out bottles of water
At its peak, more than 20,000 homes in London were left without water on Sunday.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was ""unacceptable"" that thousands of homes in the capital still lacked supply, adding: ""I have sought assurances from Thames Water that they are doing everything possible to fix the problems.""
Several schools in London and Kent have said they will be closed on Monday because they cannot guarantee running water.
Southern Water said it was working to restore supplies to up to 5,000 homes in Sittingbourne, Kent, urging customers to ""only use the water you absolutely must"".
The supplier, which serves Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, said it was working with councils and emergency services to ""make sure we're identifying vulnerable customers"" affected by shortages.
Welsh Water said between 3,000 and 6,000 customers were without water on Monday morning, saying it was dealing with 200 leaks, adding: ""It's been a really challenging 72 hours for us.""
Severn Trent apologised to customers in parts of north Derbyshire with little or no supply - but said it had restored water supplies to households in Birmingham, north Nottingham and Rugby and Southam, Warwickshire, on Sunday night.
South East Water said the cold snap and subsequent thaw had put ""extreme pressure"" on its network and has set up a number of bottled water stations in Sussex and Kent.
Wessex Water, Yorkshire Water and South West Water all said they were dealing with problems.
Welsh Water said its team had been working through Sunday night to fix bursts and detect leaks, adding: ""These problems are likely to continue over the next few days.""

Scottish Water said: ""Weather and road conditions have presented challenges in maintaining our usual response services and we apologise if you've experienced a delay in us getting to you.""

In London, customers said they could not register outages as the helpline was unavailable, while shops reportedly ran out of bottled water in some areas.

""Please do not use water for anything that isn't essential. This will make a real difference.""
Jerry White, business manager at Thames Water, said engineers were ""working extra hard"" over the weekend.
He said there had been a ""20% jump in the demand for water in the last five days"".

The problems came after a prolonged period of cold weather for much of the UK.
Water companies said that, as temperatures increased, frozen pipes thawed, causing them to contract and sometimes break.
As the snow and ice melted over the weekend, holes were then exposed.
Temperatures in most places increased over the weekend, however, two yellow warnings for ice are still in place in Scotland and for snow and ice in northern England and Northern Ireland.
A weather warning for Scotland has been extended into Tuesday.
Meanwhile, two flood warnings remains in place - in Swanage Bay, Dorset, and Halesworth, Suffolk - while 33 less severe flood alerts are in place.

"Google cancels all-staff diversity meeting
Google has cancelled an all-staff meeting to discuss a controversial memo about diversity written by former engineer James Damore.
It is reported that some staff members were concerned about being singled out online if they were identified while they spoke out during the meeting.
The firm said it would ""find a better way"" to help employees discuss the issues raised by the memo.
Mr Damore was fired for breaking Google's code of conduct.
He had suggested in his internal note that there were fewer women in tech and leadership positions because of biological differences.
, 80% of its tech workforce and 75% of its leaders are men.
""We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism,"" Mr Damore wrote in his note, which was widely criticised.
Mr Damore said he had been sent messages of support from some staff at the tech giant and he also received a job offer from Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who tweeted ""censorship is for losers"".
Google's new vice-president Danielle Brown said that his view ""advanced incorrect assumptions about gender"".
""We are unequivocal in our belief that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company, and we'll continue to stand for that and be committed to it for the long haul,"" she wrote in a statement
Analysis: Zoe Kleinman, technology reporter
The ongoing lack of diversity in the entire tech sector is an issue that has grown an even bigger head of steam in recent months, with a steady stream of stories about big firms and big names being held to account.
Women who work in the industry are increasingly choosing to speak out about their experiences in this male-dominated domain, and to challenge the statistics that demonstrate that they remain a minority, despite high-profile campaigns and initiatives aimed at redressing the balance.
James Damore's suggestion that it is because they are biologically less suited to it has caused considerable anger, particularly among those who have forged successful Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) careers.
Google has been very clear that Mr Damore did not speak on its behalf but it has also faced criticism for firing him, with critics suggesting that it the action went against the firm's principle of free speech.

"Thousands of patient follow-up letters not sent to GPs
Patients adversely affected will be contacted by the trust
Tens of thousands of hospital appointment follow-up letters have not been sent to GPs due to a computer system issue.
Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said it had a backlog of 22,000 letters, from 2011 to 2017 about patient appointments and care.
Some patients may not have received the follow-up care they should have, the chief executive said.
Patients adversely affected will be contacted by the trust.
A review is also under way.
Worcestershire Royal Hospital; Kidderminster Hospital and Treatment Centre; and Alexandra Hospital, in Redditch, are all run by the trust.
The trust, which has been rated inadequate since December 2015, was
Trust chief executive Michelle McKay said an inquiry was under way to determine what had happened
Its latest report found patients were being cared for in emergency department corridors as standard practice and no ""tangible improvements"" had been made since an earlier inspection in November.
An initial review into the letters error found 11,000 letters require no further medical actions.
The focus is now on the remaining letters, a statement said, which should be completed by September.
Analysis: Michele Paduano, BBC Midlands health correspondent
This issue came to light when the St Stephen's practice, in Redditch, received a letter which was a year old. It was one of 69 letters; fortunately, none of them were critical.
My understanding is this has been known about since at least June and I was told about it because there was some concern the public had not been made aware.
Dr Shaun Pike, the GP who chairs the Worcestershire local medical committee, said there would be a small number of patients who have suffered medically and there may be patients undiagnosed.
The plan is to review the most urgent cases first, but leave any patients who have already died until the end of the process.
Any worried patients should contact the PALS service on 0300 1231732.
Chief executive Michelle McKay apologised that some letters within the trust's management system had not been processed properly.
""We regret that this means some patients may not have received the follow-up care they should have,"" she said.
""We are working closely with our primary care colleagues and partner health organisations to urgently review the individual cases of these patients and to ensure, where appropriate, patients receive the necessary follow-up care quickly.""
She said an inquiry was under way to understand how this had happened.
""This is a serious issue which we are working hard to quickly address.
""However, it is important we reassure our local communities that more than half a million patients are seen in our outpatient departments each year and the vast majority of these patients will have had the appropriate letters sent to ensure they receive the right follow-up care.""

"Loose Women's Stacey Solomon celebrates her 'saggy boobs'
A post shared by Stacey Solomon (@staceysolomon) on
End of Instagram post by staceysolomon
Loose women panellist Stacey Soloman has been praised on social media for sharing a video celebrating her ""muffin top, saggy boobs and stretch marks"".
The former X Factor singer posted footage on Instagram in which she wears a white bikini and describes her body.
She said she was ""celebrating her society labelled imperfections"" which ""tell a story of who we are"".
The post has attracted over 2,000 comments with users praising her ""positive message to all women"".
In the video she starts by saying: ""Three things I love about my bikini body.""
She went on to talk about her ""muffin tops"" and squeezed the sides of her body before lying on the floor.
'Children's entertainment'
""Not only are they insulating but who else can lie this comfortably on a stone floor without the help of these babies?"" she added.
She said she also loves her ""saggy boobs"" because although ""they may not be what looks the best"" she no longer needs a ""bag for anything on holiday"".
The footage shows the presenter pulling out an ice pole and a pair of sunglasses from under her breasts.
Solomon rose to fame on ITV's X Factor
Solomon then points to her stretch marks and says she loves them because they ""provide hours of entertainment for the children"".
The footage shows her children drawing on her body and she says: ""Look at them, they've never been happier.""
She accompanied the video with a message addressed to ""everyone on holiday worrying about how they look"".
""You're all perfectly imperfect and unique and beautiful.
""I thought I'd make a little holiday video celebrating my society labelled 'imperfections' because actually I love them, they're part of me, and they have their uses!""
She said that if everyone shows off their insecurities ""we will all start realising nobody escapes the world of perfection that we are all under pressure to keep up with""
The video has been viewed more than 166,000 times in five hours with users saying she was a ""fantastic role model"" and commenting on their own feelings about their bodies.

"Ed Sheeran and Eminem locked in a battle for the Christmas number one
Ed Sheeran and Eminem are the front runners to be Christmas number one
Ed Sheeran's Perfect remains the front-runner for this year's Christmas number one, but Eminem is closing in fast.
The rapper is a surprise new entry at number two in the mid-week chart update with
, a song that dissects a toxic relationship.
According to the Official Charts, Sheeran is still ahead on pure sales, but Eminem is getting more streams.
""You couldn't call it one way or the other without being wrong,"" charts expert James Masterton told the BBC.
However, River also features guest vocals from a certain Ed Sheeran, the star could essentially replace himself at the top of the chart.
The Official Charts Company will reveal the winner on Friday, 22 December.

End of Youtube post by BBC Radio 1
Also in the running is Wham!'s Last Christmas, which fans are trying to get to the top spot as a tribute to George Michael, who died on Christmas Day last year.
The 80s classic is at number three in the mid-week charts, but seems unlikely to climb higher, based on current figures.
There are also rumours that Adele could release a last-minute Christmas single.
, while other reports suggest it could be a George Michael cover.

Adele could be a late entrant to the Christmas chart race
Earlier this month, Sheeran seemed to guarantee his grip on the charts by releasing multiple versions of Perfect - including a duet with Beyonce and a classical rendition featuring Andrea Bocelli.
Eminem's challenge comes as something of a surprise: River, a track on the star's ninth album, Revival, was only released on Friday and has not been promoted as a single.
""Ed's multiple versions are counting in his favour,"" says Masterton, who runs the

""It actually does make if far more interesting.""
The chart battle has left bookmakers in an awkward position. After Sheeran released the Beyonce version of Perfect, they started taking bets on him being Christmas number one ""either solo or as a duet"".
That definition would seem to include the Eminem song, meaning they'll have to pay out whoever emerges victorious.

"Painless flu jab patch for people scared of injections
Health editor, BBC News online
The patch is a few centimeters in diameter and has tiny, hair-like needles in the centre
A 'painless' sticking plaster flu jab that delivers vaccine into the skin has passed important safety tests in the first trial in people.
The patch has a hundred tiny hair-like microneedles on its adhesive side that penetrate the skin's surface.
It is simple enough for people to stick on themselves.
That should help more people get immunised, including those who are scared of injections, experts told the
, it doesn't need to be kept in the fridge, meaning pharmacies could easily stock it on their shelves for people to buy.
Most volunteers said the patch was entirely painless
Volunteers who tested it said they preferred it to injections.
It offers the same protection as a regular vaccine, but without pain, according to its developers from
, who are funded by the US National Institutes of Health.
The patch punctures the uppermost layers of the skin, whereas regular flu injections go all the way through and into muscle.
Lead researcher Prof Mark Prausnitz, who is also part of a company that wants to license the technology, said: ""If you zoom in under the microscope what you'll see are microscopically small needles. They puncture painlessly into the skin.""
His team tested the patch alongside flu injections. Some of the 100 volunteers got the regular shot in the arm, while others applied the microneedle patch to their wrist for 20 minutes.
Most said using the patch was painless, but some experienced mild side effects - redness, itching and tenderness in the area of skin area where it had been applied. These symptoms got better on their own over days.
Experts say the patch could revolutionise how flu and other vaccines are given, although more clinical tests over the next few years are needed to get the patch system approved for widespread use.
Dr Nadine Rouphael, from Emory University, said: ""We could envisage vaccination at home, in the workplace or even via mail distribution.""
The patch can be thrown in the bin after it is used because the microneedles dissolve away.
And because it can be safely stored for up to a year without refrigeration, it could prove extremely useful in the developing world.
Experts from Public Health England said it might also be good to use in young children, who tend not to like needles, although the UK has already introduced a
John Edmunds, an expert in infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: ""This study is undoubtedly an important step towards a better way to deliver future vaccines.""

"Renault conceptualizes F1 cars in 2027
Updated 1353 GMT (2153 HKT) April 19, 2017
A glimpse into the future of F1?
To celebrate 40 years in Formula One, Renault has released its vision for racing cars in 2027 -- a sleeker, greener model compared to its 2017 counterpart.
A glimpse into the future of F1?
Renault, whose engines have powered 12 constructor's titles since 1977, believes this design puts the driver at the heart of F1 racing while also improving the experience for fans.
A glimpse into the future of F1?
Renault's iconic yellow and black livery, however, remains the same, and the engine is based on the V6 turbocharged engine used by the 1977 vehicle.
A glimpse into the future of F1?
There is a display in the center of the steering wheel that shows a driver his ""fan ranking"" position, a number determined by spectators' response on social media. Drivers who get higher fan-approval ratings have an additional boost of power in the closing stages of a race.
A glimpse into the future of F1?
Lights on the wheels display a range of information such as the driver's position and the car's remaining energy reserves.
A glimpse into the future of F1?
The model is also intended to be safer than current cars. It is equipped with a self-driving function that is automatically activated when potentially dangerous incidents occur during a race. This enforces speed limits and prohibits overtaking as cars become congested.
A glimpse into the future of F1?
Helmets are transparent to enable a closer connection between fans and drivers.
A glimpse into the future of F1?
The 2027 cars have an electric mode that is activated at certain moments of the race to reduce fuel consumption.
A glimpse into the future of F1?
Sustainable materials and technologies used in the car's construction aim to improve F1's carbon footprint.
A glimpse into the future of F1?
Renault won drivers' championships with Fernando Alonso in 2005 and 2006. Today, it is represented by Nico Hulkenberg and Joylon Palmer, the former of whom has picked up two points so far this season after placing ninth in Bahrain.

"25 things you absolutely need to know about Top Gear's 25th series
The new series of Top Gear begins on Sunday with Matt LeBlanc, Rory Reid and Chris Harris returning to host.
It's the second season of the BBC Two car show to be fronted by the trio, and the 25th since the programme was re-launched in 2002.
We went along to the press launch, watched a few preview clips and interviewed LeBlanc, Reid and Harris.
(The Stig was there too but didn't have much to say.)
Here are 25 things you need to know about
1. Chris, Rory and Matt are gelling as a presenting team.
""The c-word was one that was thrown at us a lot in the first season,"" says Chris.
Nobody panic - he's talking about chemistry.
""But it was just fanciful to think that you can just create a chemistry overnight. You don't, do you?
""You have to learn where people's funnybone is before you can start to poke fun and work out where that joy lies.""
2. Producers have an interesting approach to health and safety.
""They look at a situation, and if there's a greater-than-60% chance of surviving, they'll put you in it,"" laughs Rory.
""Which I think is fair, it's good odds.""
3. Top Gear fundamentally remains a serious motoring show, thank you very much.
""[The programme] doesn't have the right to be funny and silly... unless it retains its grounding in being a car show,"" says Chris.
""I don't think you'd trust Mary Berry if you found out she couldn't bake a cake.
""So it has to review cars. It has to have an element of testing, me talking about suspension components, which many people find deeply boring, but that's what it's about.""
4. Matt is no longer in touch with Chris Evans.
""He's supposed to be here, I don't know, where he is?"" the former Friends star jokes, looking around the room.
""You know, I haven't spoken to Chris. I haven't. Not because... I just, I've been busy, he's been busy, I have no animosity towards him, you know.""
5. Rory has lost two-and-a-half stone since the last series.
For which he credits his intensive exercise regime.
6. Matt has zero time for accusations of political incorrectness on Friends.
The week we speak to Matt,
have appeared in the press about how younger generations are turning their backs on Friends because of its apparent fat shaming and homophobia.
""I've heard those rumours too about people taking pot shots at Friends, but I don't want to get into that. I disagree with all that,"" Matt says.
""On Top Gear we tend to steer clear of any sort of political content, nothing too topical.
""On Friends we steered clear of that kind of thing, too. Friends was about themes that stand the test of time - trust, love, relationships, betrayal, family and things like that.""
""Could we BE any more politically incorrect?""
7. And, now you bring it up, nor is he a fan of risque humour in general.
""I'm not in the business of making political jokes, politically incorrect jokes,"" he says.
""I don't want to make jokes that make people go 'Ooh, that's not my bag.' I don't like that, I run from that kind of stuff.
""Because that joke isn't going to be relevant in six months. You talk about 'Hey man, you lied to me,' or 'Wasn't that fun?' - that'll always be relevant.""
8. Rory now gets recognised in Sainsbury's.
Rory started out presenting the sister programme, Extra Gear, before making the leap to the main show.
""I travel a lot, and I seem to get recognised in most places. Everyone's really nice, no-one's really horrible,"" he says of his higher profile.
""But you go shopping in Sainsbury's and people stare at you, come up and have a look at what's in your trolley, take pictures of it and stuff.
""So you've got to be careful about what you're buying,"" he points out, adding that he wants to avoid any headlines like 'Rory Reid buys Â£600 of champagne.'
""Not that I'd ever do that. I'm more of a prosecco man.""
9. Matt doesn't consider himself a TV presenter.
Despite this being his third season fronting the show.
""Presenting is not what I do. I'm an actor, playing the part of a presenter. That's what I do. So is it really me you see on Top Gear? Probably not,"" he says.
""It's the me that suits the film we're making. It's the me that suits the studio portion in front of the crowd. That's what an actor does, you try to mould yourself to fit the needs of the piece.""
10. ""Granted, Spielberg's not calling me,"" he adds.
""I could give you a hundred reasons why not,"" he laughs.
11. Chris and Matt STILL haven't agreed about Bigfoot.
One episode sees the two presenters go out in search of Bigfoot.
It's fair to say they have differing opinions of the creature's existence - as this particular exchange at the press launch proved.
""Some of the ideas on the show are obviously silly. To wake up one morning and go to northern California, to go and [shouts across the room] LOOK FOR AN ANIMAL THAT DOESN'T EXIST. [Matt turns around]. Sorry, did I say that loudly?""
[Shouting back] ""It's not an animal. Not an animal.""
""Sorry, it's a gorilla. An eight-foot gorilla.""
No chance of getting this cleared up anytime soon we don't think.
12. Rory is trying to get Chris sacked. Kind of.
When asked what ideas he'd like to see explored on future seasons of Top Gear, Rory says: ""I want to see autonomous cars, self-driving cars.""
Wouldn't that leave him out of a job though?
out of a job, he gets to drive all the good stuff,"" he jokes.
13. Matt would like more money in the accommodation budget please.
Anyone concerned about how BBC money is being spent need not worry about wastage on Top Gear.
""We just got back from a week in Sri Lanka,"" Matt explains, adding sarcastically: ""[The hotel] was fantastic. I think we're spending too much on the hotel budget.
""The idea is to get all your money on the screen, apparently.""
when it comes to dealing with accommodation and catering issues in a calm and orderly manner, so we hope this gets resolved soon.
14. Chris describes Matt as an ""inveterate practical joker"".
""You never have a straightforward day,"" he says of his prank-playing co-star.
""Let's just say when we're on a photo call, he'll allow his arm to tap me somewhere that leaves me bent over double.
""There are some extraordinary images of him standing there, and he does it with the Matt LeBlanc face, and I'm doubled over and it looks like I've lost the plot completely.""
15. Matt considers England a second home.
""I do like it here. The first thing I ever did here was Lost In Space, back in '96 or '97. And then I hadn't worked here in a long time and came back to do Episodes.
""I do like England. It's like being in Europe but you can understand the language.""
16. Chris is scared of flying.
So you can imagine how a stunt in the new series involving him trying out a flying car goes down.
17. Matt thinks comparisons with Clarkson, Hammond and May are ""inevitable"".
""I was a big fan of the show before, I think it was great, those guys were great,"" he says diplomatically.
""But, they're not here anymore. They left. That had nothing to do with me. I was asked to come in, and I think, I can't do what they did. But also they can't do what I did. So it's slightly different.""
""It's natural for people to want to compare,"" he says.
""What's important is that we haven't tried to fill their shoes in any way. None of us is trying to be Clarkson, May or Hammond.""
19. And look, Chris thinks there's room for Top Gear and The Grand Tour to co-exist on television perfectly peacefully so everybody just calm down.
""Motoring has an enormous audience and it's only really served by two global shows,"" he says.
""I think the others do a great job. I think we do a great job. And long may the comparisons continue, because I'm really proud of the films that we've made in this season, I think they stack up against any opposition.""
20. Matt isn't too worried about ratings.
""I don't concern myself with that stuff, that's a network issue,"" he says. ""If you want to talk
""The level they need it to perform at, and what it does, they must be happy, we're still here, you know what I mean? So they're good enough.""
21. Top Gear remains a family show.
""It'd be very easy to try and make it a bit sweary and laddish, but it's not,"" says Chris.
""It's a staple at 8pm on a Sunday evening and you should be able to watch it with your kids.
""My youngest is seven, and I can watch Top Gear happily with him, and not worry about something that's going to embarrass me or him.""
Probably best he steers clear of Mrs Brown's Boys.
22. Petrolheads can go online if they need a bigger motoring fix.
Harris landed his Top Gear presenting gig after building up a sizeable YouTube following.
""I want to know what the ramp angles are on the differential in the car. And I can find that on YouTube. I can't find it on television, and that's why it's great [to have both],"" he says.
""In fact, the two worlds need to stop warring, because they're complimentary.
""The Top Gear brand is big online, and I love [doing the online videos]... they satisfy the geek audience. But the TV show has to be more general.""
23. The presenters don't do all their own stunts.
""We have a team of pro drivers. I'm not a pro driver, I'm probably above average, I would say, but when it gets really dodgy, you hand the car over and the pro drivers do some,"" explains Matt.
""It's not a race, we're here to make a television show. We do a lot of the driving, and sometimes out of a scheduling thing we can't be there because we're shooting something else, but for the most part it's us.""
24. There's a great sequence in the new series involving eggs.
(Perhaps the BBC is trying to compensate for the loss of Paul Hollywood.)
Chris makes a bold claim that his Citroen 2CV is such a smooth ride that you could comfortably carry a basket of eggs with you without one smashing.
25. You can probably guess what happens next.
All hell breaks loose after the first couple of eggs inevitably smash, and Matt ends up covered in more yolk than you'd ever expect one of the most recognisable actors in the world to be.
""We got a jet washer in and had to blow all the egg out,"" Chris says of the smell that the stunt left behind.
But, Rory adds: ""Chris's 2CV looks pretty broken and beaten up already, so I think the eggs were an improvement personally.""

"Fox hunting vote shelved by government
Theresa May is asked about her views on fox hunting
MPs will not vote on whether to repeal the Hunting Act for at least two years, the government says.
The Conservatives promised a free vote on fox hunting in their general election manifesto, and during the campaign Theresa May said she was in favour of bringing it back.
But Mrs May lost her majority in the election and now ministers say will be no vote in this ""session"".
The current Parliamentary session is due to last two years.
Tony Blair's Labour government introduced the Hunting Act, which bans the use of dogs to hunt foxes and wild mammals in England and Wales, in 2004.
Under David Cameron, the Conservative manifesto also promised a free vote on whether to repeal it - but no vote was held, with the widespread view that it would not pass.
There was no mention of a vote in the Queen's Speech, and the decision to shelve it during this two-year session was confirmed by environment minister Therese Coffey.
Responding to a written Parliamentary question from Labour's Catherine West, she said: ""The Government's manifesto includes a free vote on the Hunting Act 2004, but we are not planning to bring forward a free vote in this session.""
Conservative MP and former party chairman Grant Shapps welcomed the announcement.
""Fox hunting, the insane policy signalling election campaign was about to go off-the-rails, is officially dumped"", he tweeted.
Lib Dem rural affairs spokeswoman Baroness Parminter added: ""It was a ridiculous idea to reopen a debate which was comprehensively decided on ten years ago.
""In these uncertain times, the government should be focusing on the real priorities for rural communities and protecting the wildlife and countryside that they cherish.""

"Top Federal Reserve official departs
One of the top bankers at the US Federal Reserve said he will retire next month from its governing board, citing personal reasons.
The resignation of Stanley Fischer, 73, creates another vacancy on the council that oversees the US central bank.
Three spots on the seven-member board were already vacant.
The term of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is also due to expire in 2018 and it is unclear whether President Donald Trump will reappoint her.
The openings provide Mr Trump with an opportunity to make a mark at the central bank, which sets key economic policies.
In July, he nominated investor Randal Quarles to fill one of the vacancies.
Mr Fischer had served on the board of governors since 2014. His term as vice-chair was set to expire next year.
A longtime professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr Fischer previously was a governor at the Bank of Israel and vice-chairman at Citigroup.

"Arctic stronghold of world's seeds reaches one million mark
Norway's Svalbard Global Seed Vault first opened in February 2008
The vault storing the world's most precious seeds is taking delivery on Monday of donations that will take it to the one million mark.
More than 70,000 crops will be added to frozen storage chambers buried deep within a mountain in the Arctic Circle.
Cereal staples, unusual crops like the Estonian onion potato, and barley used to brew Irish beer are among the consignments.
Monday marks the tenth anniversary of the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard.
One of three chambers is now almost full of packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop.
The number of donations amounts to 1,059,646. This number excludes one emergency withdrawal of about 90,000 seeds needed to make up for precious samples stranded in Syria due to the conflict there.
""Hitting the million mark is really significant,"" said Hannes Dempenwolf, senior scientist of the Crop Trust, an international organisation dedicated to conserving the diversity of the crops we rely on for food.
""Only a few years back I don't think we would have thought that we would get there.""
Crop diversity is regarded as essential for safeguarding the future of the world's food supply amid pressures such as drought and climate change.
The reinforced vault is designed to hold back-ups of samples stored elsewhere in seed banks around the world.
Ireland Department of Agriculture, Food
Hunter barley seeds are being deposited by the Irish government
More than a million different food crops have been deposited by 73 institutions since 26 February 2008, but only one withdrawal has been made.
Deposits of wheat, lentil, chickpea and other crops stranded in a seed bank in Syria due to the civil conflict were made available for conservation work.
The vault opens about twice a year for deposits. Monday's additions include unique varieties of rice, wheat and maize; black-eyed pea - a major protein source in Africa and South Asia; and Bambara groundnut, which is being developed as a drought tolerant crop in Africa.
The resurgence of craft brewing and distilling in Ireland has led to requests from breweries for seeds of malting barley to be added to the collections.
""The hunter variety is a type of malting barley that is important for Irish crop brewing and distilling,"" said Dempenwolf.
Last year, the vault suffered flooding to the entrance of the vault due to extreme weather. However, the water did not reach the frozen chambers deep within where the seeds are stored.
New waterproof walls have been fitted to make sure water can never enter the actual vault and reinforcements are underway to prepare it for a warmer, wetter future.
Scientists estimate that there are about 2.2 million unique varieties of crops in the world's gene banks that will eventually be deposited at Svalbard.
""The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is an iconic reminder of the remarkable conservation effort that is taking place every day, around the world and around the clock - an effort to conserve the seeds of our food crops,"" said Marie Haga, executive director of the Crop Trust.
""Safeguarding such a huge range of seeds means scientists will have the best chance of developing nutritious and climate-resilient crops that can ensure future generations don't just survive, but thrive.""

'Black Panther' is heading for a record-breaking box office weekend
February 14, 2018: 2:15 PM ET

Marvel Studios is one of the most successful brands in Hollywood. The Disney subsidiary has broken box office records, brought in more than $13.5 billion worldwide, and had
. Yet, not many of its films have enjoyed the same level of buzz generated by ""
The film, starring Chadwick Boseman and directed by Ryan Coogler, opens in more than 4,000 North American theaters this weekend.
Industry analysts are projecting that the film could bring in about $145 million domestically in its opening weekend, which starts Thursday. ""Black Panther"" could rake in more than $160 million during the four day President's Day weekend, analysts say.
Disney anticipates an opening in the $150 million range for the four day holiday weekend.
""Black Panther"" could easily become the biggest February opening in history, toppling ""Deadpool,"" the R-rated superhero film from 20th Century Fox that brought in $132 million when it opened in 2016.(""Deadpool"" also holds the four day President's Day opening record at $152 million).
""Black Panther's"" three day projections would also put it in the top openings for a Marvel Studios film and in the top ten opening for the superhero genre overall.
These staggering numbers are a reflection of the film's popularity and the buzz that started months before ""Black Panther"" even premiered. Earlier this week, Twitter announced that ""Black Panther"" is the most tweeted movie of the year, amassing more than 5 million tweets ahead of its February 15 opening day.
""Black Panther"" could have a record-breaking opening weekend for Disney and Marvel Studios.
Related: 'Black Panther' is outselling every previous superhero film in advance ticket sales
""Rarely do movies generate this particular type of excitement,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for
Dergarabedian said ""Black Panther"" is impressive because of its box office potential and its cultural significance. ""Black Panther"" is Marvel's
and one of the first major superhero films with a predominantly African-American cast.
""The film is breaking down barriers and challenging outmoded preconceived notions of what the genre can look like,"" Dergarabedian said. ""Every Marvel film that succeeds critically and financially is always a win for Disney, but with 'Black Panther' the rewards will be even greater given the importance of the film and its cultural impact.""

"Carrie Fisher died from 'sleep apnea and other causes'
Actress Carrie Fisher made her name in the Star Wars series
Star Wars actress Carrie Fisher died from sleep apnea and ""other factors"", the Los Angeles County coroner says.
Her death certificate said in January that the 60-year-old, best known for her role as Princess Leia, had suffered a cardiac arrest.
But in a statement the LA coroner said the exact cause was unknown.
Sleep apnea is a common condition in which a person stops breathing during sleep, either for a few seconds or minutes.
As well as listing sleep apnea as a cause of death, the coroner's statement cited other factors, including heart disease and drug use.
Her manner of death would be listed as undetermined, it said.
Fisher had been on tour promoting her book The Princess Diarist when she was taken ill on a flight from London to Los Angeles on 23 December.
She never regained consciousness and

"King Power: Leicester City's owners 'being sued for £323m'
Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and his family own Leicester City and King Power
The owners of Leicester City Football Club are reportedly being sued for £323m over money owed to the Thai government.
A criminal court in Bangkok accepted the case against King Power International on Monday, according to Reuters news agency.
The case is also being brought against executives of state-owned Airports of Thailand (AOT), Reuters says.
The BBC has contacted Leicester City FC, King Power and AOT for comment.
The lawsuit accuses King Power of failing to pay the Thai government 14 billion baht (£323m) from the operation of a duty-free franchise it was awarded in 2006.
At a hearing on Monday, the Central Criminal Court in Bangkok accepted the case and said it would now hear from witnesses in February next year.
The action against King Power, owned by Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and his family, was initially filed in July.

"First vaccine shows gonorrhoea protection
Health and science reporter, BBC News website
A vaccine has for the first time been shown to protect against the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhoea, scientists in New Zealand say.
There are fears gonorrhoea is becoming untreatable as antibiotics fail.
The World Health Organization sees developing a vaccine as vital in stopping the global spread of ""super-gonorrhoea"".
The study of 15,000 young people,
, showed infections were cut by about a third.
About 78 million people pick up the sexually transmitted infection each year, and it can cause infertility.
But the body does not build up resistance no matter how many times someone is infected.
The vaccine, originally developed to stop an outbreak of meningitis B, was given to about a million adolescents in New Zealand between 2004 and 2006.
Researchers at the University of Auckland analysed data from sexual health clinics and found gonorrhoea cases had fallen 31% in those vaccinated.
The bacterium that causes meningitis,
, is a very close relative of the species that causes gonorrhoea -
It appears the Men B jab was giving ""cross-protection"" against gonorrhoea.
Dr Helen Petousis-Harris, one of the researchers, said: ""This is the first time a vaccine has shown any protection against gonorrhoea.
""At the moment, the mechanism behind this immune response is unknown, but our findings could inform future vaccine development.""
Protection seemed to last about two years.
CAVALLINI JAMES/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY
The disease is caused by the bacterium
and spread by unprotected sex.
Symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods.
However, of those infected, about one in 10 heterosexual men and more than three-quarters of women and gay men have no easily recognisable symptoms.
Untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and be passed on to a child during pregnancy.
However, the vaccine in question - known as MeNZB - is no longer available.
Many of its components are also in a new Men B jab - called 4CMenB.
The UK is the only country in the world to be rolling 4CMenB out as a routine childhood immunisation.
Fellow researcher Prof Steven Black, from Cincinnati Children's Hospital in the US, said: ""The potential ability of a group B meningococcal vaccine to provide even moderate protection against gonorrhoea would have substantial public health benefits.""
The importance of preventing people developing a gonorrhoea infection is of mounting importance as the infection is getting much harder to treat.
Last week, the World Health Organization warned about the global spread of gonorrhoea that could not be treated with antibiotics.
Dr Teodora Wi, from the WHO, said there had even been three cases - in Japan, France and Spain - where the infection was completely untreatable.
She said: ""There are high hopes that now there's going to be some cross-protection.
""We are still a long way before we develop a vaccine for gonorrhoea, but we have now some evidence that it is possible.""

"The app that inspires tens of millions to go cycling
Business reporter, BBC News
Mark Gainey did not let injury stop him from cycling for long
Thankfully for tens of millions of cyclists around the world, Mark Gainey didn't walk away from the sport when he had a nasty crash back in 2002.
Racing his bike down a steep road in California, he hit a pothole and went flying, shattering his left arm and elbow. He required no less than 11 operations to repair the damage.
Many of us wouldn't want to look at a bike again after that, but Mark got back on the saddle and a few years later he and a friend came up with the idea for what has become the world's most popular cycling app - Strava.
If you aren't a keen cyclist then you may not have heard of it but for those of us who do like peddling around on two wheels it isn't an exaggeration to say that the app has been revolutionary.
Utilising the GPS (global positioning system) software on your smart phone, it enables you to record your ride, and then see an accurate line of the route you have cycled on an electronic map.
It tells you how far and fast you have cycled, and you can compare your times over certain sections - such as popular hill climbs - with both how well you have done before and with other Strava users.
This means that you can compete to beat other people's times and aim to be ""the king (or queen) of the mountain"" of a certain stretch of the road.
The Strava app is continuing to see user numbers soar
First launched in 2009 and since expanding to running and other sports, Strava now has tens of millions of users around the world, many of whom find it completely addictive.
The word Strava is even used as a verb, as in ""I'm going to strava this ride"" and the saying: ""If it isn't on Strava then it doesn't count"".
While it has numerous rivals whose apps do similar things, such as Map My Ride and Endomondo, Strava's user numbers tower over the others. It claims that an additional one million people join every 45 days.
But despite its vast popularity and the fact that it is backed by $70m (Â£54m) of investment, the company (which doesn't reveal its financial results) is widely reported to have not yet made a profit. So what is the problem and how can it change it?
The app was inspired by the idea to help boost camaraderie among fellow athletes
Mark Gainey, 48, says that the original genesis of the idea for San Francisco-based Strava came when he and co-founder Michael Horvath graduated from Harvard University.
""Back in the late 1980s Michael and I rowed together at Harvard. It was an incredible experience, pretty special, with great camaraderie.
""The only problem was that we then graduated and - whoosh - that all just disappeared.
""So brainstorming ideas for businesses we said 'wouldn't it be great to replicate that camaraderie in the boathouse'. The idea was to create a virtual locker room for athletes to compare times. Unfortunately the technology just didn't exist at the time.""
Fast-forward to 2008 and still friends, Mark and Michael had not forgotten their idea. By then Mark had spent almost two decades in the software sector, while Michael was a business and economics lecturer who also dabbled in the IT industry.
By then technology had made their idea possible, with the invention of GPS recorders and the iPhone and other smart phones. And the likes of Facebook had made people used to sharing information about themselves online.
The app has since expanded to cycling and other sports such as skiing
And so the two friends launched Strava, the name being the Swedish word for ""strive"" in reference to Michael's ancestry.
The app was an immediate word-of-mouth hit and user numbers soon skyrocketed and haven't slowed since.
With its largest number of users in the US followed by the UK and Brazil, commentators put Strava's success compared with its smaller rivals down to a combination of its ease of use, and larger focus on sociability - the ability to see what friends are up to, chat and comment on each other's rides, and give someone ""kudos"" for a good ride.
Mark refers to this as Strava's ""secret sauce"", and he has huge ambitions for the company. ""We want to be the trusted sports brand of the 21st Century, but instead of needle and thread it is bits and bytes,"" he says.
The financial problem for Strava is that its basic free offering is so good most users aren't tempted to upgrade to its paid-for ""premium"" service.
The company won't release the percentage figure for the number of premium users, but commentators say it is likely around the 20% mark.
Users of the app can upload their own photos
As Mark confirms that the company's main revenue stream remains premium subscribers, it needs to see if it can increase this.
Strava is also hoping to increase the money it makes from merchandise, tie-ups with sports firms, and using its data to work with local authorities around the world to improve and increase their provision of bike lanes.
To help boost Strava's earning potential, it has recently brought in a new chief executive, James Quarles, who joined from Instagram. The change saw Mark move from that role to the chairman position.
Mark says: ""We want to take Strava from tens of millions [in] revenues to hundreds of millions, and James will lead that.""
Mark has switched from chief executive to chairman
UK cycling journalist Rebecca Charlton says it is hard to overstate how successfully Strava had turned itself into a ""social network for athletes, a kind of home for their athletic lives"".
Meanwhile, US cycling industry commentator Scott Montgomery predicts that Strava will indeed have a profitable future.
""They say in the technology sector that the first is the winner, and the second is forgotten, and Strava has definitely beaten its rivals.
""Somebody has done a great job on the marketing side and the app is very easy to use. They are now at the stage where they own a vast audience, and if you are in that position you will get profitable.""
Mark adds: ""We are the world's social network for athletes, but I'm also very pleased that we are simply encouraging more people to be active.""

"Lone workers' phone has red alarm button
Swedish mobile phone company Doro has unveiled a hard-wearing handset designed for people such as social workers, carers and builders who work alone.
The Doro 8020X features a red ""call for help"" button on the side.
If the button is pressed, the phone can send a text message containing its GPS location to up to five contacts.
There are other apps on the market offering a similar service for other mobile phones.
They can take over an existing ""home"" button for this purpose.
Chris Millington, managing director of Doro in the UK and Ireland, said he believed the company's offering was competitively priced and was easier to distribute on a bespoke device.
The Android-powered handset, which retails at £220 in the UK, is based around the concept of ""tough phones"", which are chunkier devices designed to survive rougher environments.
It is also compatible with Doro's automated care centre, i-care, for which the company charges a 48-euro (£40, $52) subscription per year.
I-care enables employers to closely monitor the status of the phone, including battery power and periods of inactivity.
It can also send messages asking if the owner of the phone is all right.
It is designed for people who work on their own - either in hazardous environments or entering others' homes by themselves.
""We don't want to do 'me-too hardware', but to deliver our service on to someone else's [device] is not so easy,"" said Mr Millington.
""You need a system that's going to take over control of the device.""
Until now, Doro had specialised in handsets for older people and it had 130,000 subscribers for its range of ""digital telecare solutions"", Mr Millington said.
Smartphone expert Ben Wood, from CCS Insight, said Doro was entering a competitive market, already crowded with both rugged devices, such as those offered by construction brands De Walt and Cat, and dedicated care apps.
""It is interesting Doro is making the jump from seniors to lone works, but I can see the synergies - many of the requirements are the same,"" he said.
""It has a strong position in the 'phones for seniors' market and works with all the main networks in the UK.""

"Humans now 'dwarf natural climate effects'
Manmade climate change is now dwarfing the influence of natural trends on the climate, scientists say.
Last year was the second or third hottest year on record - after 2016 and on a par with 2015, the data shows.
But those two years were affected by El Niño - the natural phenomenon centred on the tropical Pacific Ocean which works to boost temperatures worldwide.
What is remarkable about 2017 is that it was so warm without feeling the influence of an El Niño.
The acting director of the
, Prof Peter Stott, told BBC News: ""It's extraordinary that temperatures in 2017 have been so high when there's no El Niño. In fact, we’ve been going into cooler La Niña conditions.
""Last year was substantially warmer than 1998 which had a very big El Niño.
""It shows clearly that the biggest natural influence on the climate is being dwarfed by human activities – predominantly CO₂ emissions.""
Prof Dave Reay from the University of Edinburgh added: ""When even the 'colder' years are rewriting the warmest-year record books - we know we have a problem.
""Global temperatures will continue to bob up and down from year to year, but the climate tide beneath them is rising fast.""
El Niño sees higher sea-surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific which boosts warmth worldwide
Figures were published on Thursday by the world’s three main agencies monitoring global temperatures: the UK Met Office and the two US organisations - the
Their datasets are compiled from many thousands of temperature measurements taken across the globe, from all continents and all oceans.
Temperatures for 2017 and 2015 are virtually identical.
Nasa rates 2017 the second hottest year, and Noaa and the Met Office judge it the third hottest since records began in 1850.
shows that 2017 was 0.99C (±0.1C) above ""pre-industrial"" levels – that’s taken as the average over the period 1850-1900.
It was 0.38 (±0.1C) above the 1981-2010 average.
The Exeter-based agency calculates that the El Niño event spanning 2015-2016 contributed around 0.2C to the annual average for 2016. But that influence was gone by 2017.
The World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said the long-term temperature trend was far more important than the ranking of individual years.
""That trend is an upward one,"" he said. “Seventeen of the 18 warmest years on record have all been during this century, and the degree of warming during the past three years has been exceptional.
“Arctic warmth has been especially pronounced and this will have profound and long-lasting repercussions on sea levels, and on weather patterns in other parts of the world.”
Prof Tim Osborn from the University of East Anglia said climate models were now accurately predicting which places would warm fastest. He explained: “We’re seeing greater warming over land and in the Arctic regions, and less warming in the sub-polar oceans.
“These are what we expect from our understanding of climate physics, and this is what we observe.”
He said uncertainties arising from incomplete global coverage of weather stations had been included in the calculations.
Last year was notable for some very extreme weather events, says Noaa
Commenting on the figures, Bob Ward, from the Grantham Institute at the London School of Economics, pointed out that this year governments were due to start assessing the gap between their collective ambitions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the goals of the Paris climate agreement, to stabilise temperature rise below 2C, and as close to 1.5 as possible.
“The record temperature should focus the minds of world leaders, including President Trump, on the scale and urgency of the risks that people, rich and poor, face around the world from climate change,"" he said.
Earlier this week, a study in the journal Nature concluded that climate change needed urgently to be tackled, but forecast that apocalyptic predictions of a temperature rise of 6C by 2100 would not come about.
Prof Richard Allan from the University of Reading said: “Rather than warming being inconsequential or catastrophic, as some have suggested, we can be sure societies are facing a dangerous temperature rise, but one which we still have time to fix.
“The conclusions confirm that human-caused climate change is a serious concern.
“But if we act now with sustained and substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, societies will still be able to avoid much of the most dangerous climate change predicted by computer simulations.”
Other temperature analyses exist apart from the ""big three"", but these all tell broadly the same narrative. The European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting issued its bulletin on 4 January.

"Jo Whiley moves to Radio 2 drivetime slot
Jo Whiley currently presents Radio 2's evening show, championing new music
Jo Whiley is to co-present a new, extended drivetime show with Simon Mayo, as Radio 2 overhauls its schedule.
Whiley will be the first female DJ on the station's weekday daytime schedule for 20 years.
Debbie Thrower was the last, presenting Radio 2's afternoon show between 1995 and 1998.
At a time when pay equality is under scrutiny at the BBC, Radio 2 confirmed Mayo and Whiley will earn the same.
In other changes to the station's line-up, Sara Cox will present a new show from 22:00 to midnight every Monday to Thursday.
Gary Davies replaces Cox on the popular Sound of the 80s programme while 6 Music's Cerys Matthews takes over the Blues Show from Paul Jones, who leaves the station after more than 30 years.
The Arts Show will be ending, as will The Organist Entertains - which has been on the network for almost 50 years.
Nigel Ogden (right) has presented The Organist Entertains for 38 years
Presenter Nigel Ogden thanked listeners for supporting the show over the last five decades.
""I've loved hearing from them and send them my very best wishes for the future. I'd also like to thank Radio 2 for giving me the opportunity to play the music I love each week. It has been a huge privilege.""
Listen to the Band is also being taken off the air. Radio 2 says brass band music will continue to be played elsewhere.
The changes will come into effect from 14 May.
Whiley, who joined Radio 2 in 2011, currently hosts a weeknight show specialising in new music.
She started her career as a researcher on Channel 4's The Word and hosted Radio 1's Evening Session with Steve Lamacq at the height of Britpop.
The new drivetime show is the first time she has shared the microphone with Mayo.
As Simon Mayo knows, presenting at drivetime often means eating dinner during the songs
""Although we've known each other for over 20 years, we've never presented a show together,"" said Mayo in a statement. ""And given that Jo is quite brilliant, it's high time we put that right.""
""What a thrill to be working with Simon on this exciting new show,"" added Whiley.
""It's going to be great fun and listeners can look forward to some incredible music and chat, as well as being introduced to some fantastic new talent along the way. Cannot wait! ""
Their pairing results in an extra hour of radio, with the drivetime slot extended from 17:00 to 20:00 every weekday, except Friday - when Tony Blackburn's Golden Hour remains from 19:00 to 20:00.
As a result, the weekly Blues, Jazz, Folk and Country shows will move one hour later - starting at 20:00 from Monday to Thursday.
According to figures published by the BBC last July, Mayo currently receives a salary in the range £350,000 - £399,999, while Whiley is paid £150,000 - £199,999.
Although they will receive equal pay for their upcoming show, there will still be a disparity in their total salaries, as Mayo presents a weekly show for 5 Live, and Whiley hosts events including Glastonbury for BBC television.

"Chocolate poisoning risk to dogs at Christmas
Dogs have been known to snaffle chocolate decorations, gifts and advent calendars
Chocolate poisoning is a risk to the family dog at Christmas, say vets.
They warn that dogs are four times more likely to fall ill from eating it at this time of year.
A study found hundreds of cases of dogs needing veterinary treatment after stealing chocolate Santas, selection boxes, chocolate oranges and even a mug of hot chocolate.
Vets are trying to get the message across that it should be kept out of reach from the family pet.
While dogs like the taste of chocolate, it can make them ill, even in small quantities.
''The take home message is firstly to make sure that people recognise that chocolate is a potential problem and to be vigilant with their chocolate gifts over the holiday period,'' said Dr Philip Jones, lecturer in veterinary epidemiology and public health at the University of Liverpool.
''If their dog does get access... to make sure that they contact their veterinary surgeon.
''And also before they contact their veterinary surgeon to have an estimate of how much chocolate and what type of chocolate the dog has eaten.''
The chemical theobromine, found in cocoa beans, is broken down more slowly in dogs. This can lead to sickness, increased heart rate, agitation, seizure, and, occasionally, death.
Electronic health records from 200 veterinary practices - about 10% of the total number in the UK - were analysed for the study, between 2012 and 2017.
The research found chocolate intoxication was four times more likely at Christmas than on a normal day. The risk was half that at Easter, but there was no difference on Valentine's Day and Halloween.
Vomiting was the most common symptom of chocolate poisoning, followed by agitation and increased heart rare.
Younger dogs were more likely to snaffle chocolate and fall ill. In most cases, only small amounts were consumed. However, there were exceptions, such as when a dog ate a large number of Easter eggs hidden in a garden for a children's party.
Treatment for poisoning depends on the amount of time that has passed since the dog ate.
The dog may be given medicine to induce vomiting and activated charcoal to stop further absorption of the toxic substance.
The dog may then need fluid therapy and further medication to combat toxic effects on the heart.
The study is published in the journal,

Anna Nordqvist defies severe weather to win Evian Championship
Cites influence of late grandfather in second major victory
Tells CNN Sport: ""I hate to give up""
Torrential rain lashed the players and hail formed in puddles on the greens, but Anna Nordqvist clung to the advice of her late grandather and refused to give up as she clinched the
The 30-year-old Swede emerged from the storm to beat America's Brittany Altomare
in France, the mantra of her grandfather ringing in her ears.
It was her second major title, eight years after the first, and came a few short months after she battled a bout of glandular fever.
""My grandfather was an amazing person and he still inspires me today,"" Nordqvist told CNN Sport.
""He has always been a huge inspiration -- he'd always email me, text me or Skype me to tell me to always keep my head up and never give up.
""The last couple of months haven't been easy for me but I've just tried to do my best and it's paid off.""
In the middle of the storm shines a light coming from the North. Congratulations
— Evian Championship (@EvianChamp)
Nordqvist has had 12 top-10 major finishes since her breakthrough triumph at the 2009 LPGA Championship, and only
stopped her contending for the 2016 US Open trophy.
She has had to watch and wait while a succession of new, younger names have clinched the LPGA Tour's biggest titles.
But her determination has paid off.
A picture says more than a thousand words.
— Anna Nordqvist (@ANordqvist)
""Yeah, the US Open was obviously tough, but I kind of left it behind me as soon as I was leaving the parking lot,"" said Nordqvist, who climbed from 13th to number four in the world.
""It's just unfortunate what happened. I didn't get the trophy but I knew I was close to hopefully winning another major.""
Nordqvist trailed leader Moriya Jutanugarn by five shots going into the final round, and it took a stellar back nine -- comprised of three birdies, an eagle and just one dropped shot -- before she even considered lifting the trophy that drab afternoon.
""I grew up playing golf in Sweden, and played quite a bit during the winter,"" she said. ""So that definitely helped me, just knowing I could play well in those tough conditions.""
Nordqvist and Altomare tied at nine under at the conclusion of 54 holes - the tournament was shortened by a round after Thursday was washed out -- and the Swede won at the first extra hole.

Mbappé to join French club PSG
Signing will initially be a one-year loan deal
Mbappé, 18, had been a Monaco player
Not content with making Neymar soccer's most expensive player, French club Paris Saint-Germain has signed Kylian Mbappé -- regarded as of one of the world's most promising teenagers -- from Monaco.
The 18-year-old Mbappé, who was born in Paris, will initially make the move to PSG from French champions Monaco on a one-year loan before signing a permanent deal.
Neither club have revealed the financial figures involved in the transfer, but a fee of $214 million has been widely reported, which would make Mbappé the world's second most expensive player.
""The international French striker is transferred on a loan basis from AS Monaco until June 30 2018,"" said PSG on its website.
""The loan agreement also includes a call option for Paris Saint-Germain which, when exercised, will bind the player to Paris Saint-Germain until June 30 2022.""
Last season, Mbappé was a key member of a Monaco team that pipped PSG to the Ligue 1 title and also reached the Champions League semifinals. He scored 26 goals in 44 games.
What's behind the success of AS Monaco?
What's behind the success of AS Monaco?
""It was essential for French football that we keep and help develop such a great talent in our championship,"" PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi told the French club's website.
""Among players of his age, he is without doubt the most promising in the world due to his immense technical, physical and mental qualities.""
Mbappé scored 27 goals in 60 games for Monaco.
This summer Mbappé has been coveted by some of Europe's top clubs with Barcelona and Real Madrid reportedly leading the race for the French star, who has now opted to continue playing in Ligue 1.
""It is with great joy and pride that I join Paris Saint-Germain,"" Mbappé told the PSG website. ""For any young person from the Paris region, it is often a dream to wear the red and blue jersey and experience the unique atmosphere of the Parc des Princes.
""I really wanted to be a part of the club's project, which is one of the most ambitious in Europe.""
However, Mbappé's transfer could prove a watershed moment for the effectiveness of governing body
issued in January, PSG's 2015/16 revenue came to $627 million.
Under the terms of Financial Fair Play, introduced by UEFA seven years ago to slow the game's spending, players' wages can't constitute more than 70% of a club's income and losses can't exceed €30 million ($35 million) over a three-year period.
PSG brought in an estimated $618 million in 2016/17 -- of which over $350m was from commercial sources --
The Neymar fee alone comes to over 42% of the club's entire income last season -- leaving aside his reported wages of more than half-a-million dollars per week.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has criticized the Neymar deal, calling it ""beyond calculation and beyond rationality.""
UEFA declined to comment on the exact details of the Mbappé deal, but did say in a statement"" ""As part of the continuous monitoring of clubs under financial fair play regulations, UEFA will look into the details of these transfers in due course to ensure PSG are compliant with FFP requirements.""
PSG have previously fallen foul of FFP regulations and in 2014 they were fined $72 million and had their Champions League squad reduced from 25 to 21 for failing to break even for the period from 2011-2014.

"Business bodies come together in call for softer Brexit
Five major UK business bodies have come together to call for continued access to the European single market until a final Brexit deal is made with the EU.
In a letter to Business Secretary Greg Clark, they also ask the government to ""put the economy first"".
The letter is from the British Chambers of Commerce, Confederation of British Industry, EEF, Federation of Small Businesses and Institute of Directors.
Formal Brexit negotiations between the EU and the UK
The signatories say the ""economic benefits"" of the European Union single market, which allows free movement of goods, services, capital and people, and the customs union, which enables tariff-free trading within the EU, should be maintained until a final settlement between the UK and the EU is ""agreed and implemented"".
They have also called for a final trade deal that will allow tariff-free goods to be traded between the UK and the EU.
In addition, they want that deal to include ""minimal customs formalities"", mutual recognition of standards and regulation, and a ""flexible system"" for the movement of labour and skills.

"Theresa May's cabinet: Who's in and who's out?
Theresa May has formed her new government after the Conservatives lost their majority in the general election.
The prime minister's room for manoeuvre in the reshuffle was limited when
Here's what we know so far. The list will be updated as new appointments are made.
Prime Minister - Theresa May
Theresa May stays as prime minister despite not achieving the mandate for Brexit she had called the election for. The UK's second female PM took up the role after David Cameron resigned in the wake of the EU referendum result.
She had previously been home secretary for six years.
First Secretary of State - Damian Green
Damian Green has been promoted to a new role the prime minister did not have in her first cabinet - that of first secretary of state. As the same time he also replaces Ben Gummer as minister for the Cabinet Office after Mr Gummer lost his seat in the election.
The move effectively makes the former work and pensions secretary, a friend and ally of Theresa May, her second in command. It could see Mr Green standing in for Mrs May at PMQs when she is not available.
The role - which was previously held by George Osborne and, under Labour, Peter Mandelson - gives Mr Green seniority over other cabinet ministers.
Chancellor of the Exchequer - Philip Hammond
Philip Hammond remains as chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary.
Mr Hammond, 61, is seen at Westminster as the ultimate safe pair of hands steering Britain's economy through the post-Brexit period ahead.
Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery, he forged a reputation in the shadow Treasury team as the Tories' public spending ""axeman"".
Foreign Secretary - Boris Johnson
No change at the Foreign Office as Boris Johnson keeps his job. Despite hints from some of the newspapers that Mr Johnson, 52, may turn his hand to trying to lead the party, he has categorically dismissed such claims.
Mr Johnson said that while the public would be wondering about the future of the current government, Mrs May had got the biggest Conservative mandate anyone had achieved for decades.
""I'm going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her as well.""
Home Secretary - Amber Rudd
Amber Rudd remains as home secretary despite only narrowly holding her seat as MP for Hastings and Rye. During the election campaign, she stood in for the PM in the BBC's televised debate in May.
Ms Rudd was previously energy and climate change secretary, a position she held for just one year.
The former investment banker, venture capitalist and financial journalist, aged 53, decided to enter politics in her 40s in order to get ""a grip on her life"".
Secretary of State for Exiting the EU - David Davis
David Davis keeps his job of secretary of state for exiting the European Union - or ""Brexit secretary"". The role was created in July to take the lead in negotiating the UK's exit from the EU.
A veteran Eurosceptic, he has previously held the positions of Conservative party chairman and shadow deputy prime minister. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the shadow home secretary under both Michael Howard and David Cameron.
Mr Davis, 68, lost to David Cameron in the 2005 Tory leadership contest.
Defence Secretary - Michael Fallon
Michael Fallon has kept his job at the Ministry of Defence - a position the 65-year-old has held since 2014.
He was Conservative MP for Darlington from 1983 to 1992 - initially during Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street - and after leaving Parliament was later re-elected as MP for Sevenoaks in 1997.
A former Conservative Party deputy chairman, Mr Fallon has previously served as energy and business minister, and before that secretary of state for business and enterprise.
Secretary of State for International Trade - Liam Fox
Liam Fox, 55, continues as the secretary of state for international trade. He was made secretary of state for defence in 2010 but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.
Mr Fox stood in the leadership race against Theresa May but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.
He told reporters he was ""delighted"" to keep the job he has held since July last year.
""It's now time for the whole of the Conservative party to rally behind the prime minister and get a government in the national interest.""
Justice Secretary - David Lidington
Former Leader of the House of Commons David Lidington gets the job of justice secretary, replacing Liz Truss.
He had been Europe Minister since 2010 but moved across to aid the smooth running of the Commons in 2016.
The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.
Leader of the House of Lords - Baroness Evans
Baroness Evans of Bowes Park keeps her job as the leader of the House of Lords. When appointed in 2016, it was her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.
She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation which ran Michael Gove's free schools programme.
Health Secretary - Jeremy Hunt
Jeremy Hunt remains in his post despite the problems within the NHS.
He took over the health portfolio following a cabinet reshuffle in 2012, and at the time described the appointment as the ""biggest privilege of my life"". But in a tweet he admitted there were ""challenges ahead, but also huge opportunities to make our NHS even better"".
Last year, Mr Hunt was locked in a battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes.
Education Secretary - Justine Greening
Justine Greening has kept her roles as education secretary and minister for women and equalities. She is part of
as she openly defines herself as a lesbian.
At London Pride in 2016, the 48-year-old announced in a tweet she was in a same-sex relationship, saying ""I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"".
Ms Greening replaced Nicky Morgan at education in 2016, leaving her international development secretary post, which she was promoted to in 2011.
She has been MP for Putney since 2005.
Transport Secretary - Chris Grayling
Chris Grayling remains as transport secretary in Theresa May's cabinet.
The former Leader of the House has been dealing with Southern Rail's disrupted services, the question of Heathrow's third runway and the high speed rail link, HS2.
He also served as shadow transport secretary from December 2005 to 2007.
Culture Secretary - Karen Bradley
Karen Bradley has kept her role as Culture, Media and Sport Secretary. She had been working with Theresa May as a Home Office minister since 2014.
She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.
Environment Secretary - Michael Gove
Michael Gove has made a comeback, with the prime minister bringing him back into cabinet and appointing him environment secretary.
In the 2016 reshuffle he was sacked as justice secretary and before that he served under David Cameron as education secretary and chief whip in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
Despite campaigning alongside Boris Johnson for Brexit, he withdrew his support for Mr Johnson to be Conservative leader and prime minister, choosing instead to stand himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs, coming third.
Mr Gove's surprise move to stand for the leadership effectively dashed his colleague's hopes of winning and prompted Mr Johnson's withdrawal from the contest.
Work and Pensions Secretary - David Gauke
A sideways step for David Gauke, with the PM appointing him as the new work and pensions secretary. He was previously the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who attends cabinet but does not have a ministerial role.
Mr Gauke has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005. He is a qualified solicitor and worked for a leading City firm until he was elected.
Communities Secretary - Sajid Javid
Sajid Javid keeps his job as secretary of the department for communities and local government.
He held this position in 2014 before being appointed to business secretary a year later.
A former managing director of Deutsche Bank, Mr Javid has been MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire since 2010.
He stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the leadership election, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.
Northern Ireland Secretary - James Brokenshire
James Brokenshire continues as the Northern Ireland Secretary. He previously worked with the PM at the Home Office, where he was immigration minister.
From 2011 to 2015, he served as security minister at the Home Office with responsibility for domestic national security and counter-terrorism. This included supporting the home secretary with oversight of the work of MI5 and the national police counter-terrorism network.
Mr Brokenshire's responsibilities also included the government's counter-terrorism strategy and he was part of the prime minister's ""extremism taskforce"". He also led negotiations with the Jordanian government to secure the
Welsh Secretary - Alun Cairns
Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remains in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales.
The 46-year-old, who was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport, was elected in 2010.
He worked in banking for a decade before his election to the Welsh Assembly.
Scottish Secretary - David Mundell
David Mundell will continue as secretary of state for Scotland. He is one of 13 Scottish Conservatives to be in Parliament after this snap election.
Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.
In January 2015, Mr Mundell became the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet secretary.
Conservative Party chairman and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster - Patrick McLoughlin
Patrick McLoughlin remains as the Conservative Party chairman and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
He left his role as transport secretary in 2016 but has been an MP since 1986.
The former miner also served as chief whip after being appointed to the role in David Cameron's first cabinet.
Leader of the House of Commons - Andrea Leadsom
Andrea Leadsom has been given the job of the Leader of the House of Commons. She was the former environment secretary who dramatically pulled out of the Conservative leadership race.
Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.
Business and Energy Secretary - Greg Clark
Greg Clark keeps his job as secretary of state of business, energy and industrial strategy.
The role, when it was created by Labour's Gordon Brown, was originally called the Department of Energy and Climate Change.
Last year, it was merged into the new department and lost the ""climate change"" part of its name.
Environmentalists immediately expressed concern that the reshaping of departments showed the government was downgrading climate change as a priority.
International Development Secretary - Priti Patel
Priti Patel remains as International Development Secretary. She was promoted from her role as employment minister, which she held for a year, in 2016.
Ms Patel became MP for Witham in 2010 and joined the front bench as a Treasury minister in 2014.
She is no stranger to controversy, having previously advocated bringing back the death penalty and was accused of ""divide and rule politics"" during the referendum campaign for claiming that ""biased"" immigration policy prevents curry chefs from outside the EU from working in the UK.
On her appointment, she immediately faced calls to guarantee the UK's legal commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.

"'My skin disease will kill me but I want to help the next generation'
""You can't leave EB behind for a day. It's always with you.""
James Dunn is 24 and has Epidermolysis Bullosa, also known as EB.
It's a rare genetic skin condition which causes his skin to blister and tear ""at the slightest of touch"".
One of the side-effects of James' EB is a terminal type of skin cancer called quamous cell carcinoma. There's no known cure for EB, and it's likely to kill James before he's 30.
It's estimated there are more than 5,000 people living with EB in the UK, and 500,000 worldwide
""When I was a kid I never thought about that side of it,"" James tells Newsbeat.
""But as I got older, and as the condition progressed to skin cancer, even though I knew it was a life-limiting condition I was still shocked I got it.
""You never think you're going to be in that situation. It was a rough year or so. It affected my state of mind.
""However, I feel great now and I think if I stay positive and happy I'll stay as healthy as I can.""
The EB charity DEBRA estimates that more than 5,000 people have the condition in the UK.
James has to wear bandages from the neck down to guard his skin, which take four hours to change every other day.
He also has to take morphine every two hours to help cope with the pain and is often ""up all night"" itching his skin.
""However, I've tried my hardest to do the things I want to do,"" he says.
""What's important is keeping a healthy mind.
""I've jumped over, or should I say wheeled around, obstacles and I don't let anything get in the way.
""I don't see myself as different. I see myself as the same as my peers.""
As a keen photographer, James is helping to fundraise by collecting pictures of celebrities to fund research into EB ""to support people living with the condition and pave the way for future generations.""
The charity DEBRA wants to raise Â£500,000 towards trials for a new drug that it is believed will have a significant impact on the lives of other people living with the condition.
So far James has collected photos with Alan Carr, Cheryl, Danny DeVito and Spiderman star Tom Holland.
He will also meet MPs as part of the campaign.
""As well as making people aware of the condition in the outside world I also want to make it a topic of discussion within Parliament.
""Not as much money goes into research for EB because it's so rare.""

"Hull window cleaner saves defaced Banksy mural
The damaged mural (top) and after the whitewash had been removed (bottom)
A defaced mural by the graffiti artist Banksy on a disused bridge in Hull has been saved by a window cleaner.
The stencilled design depicts a child carrying a wooden sword with a pencil attached to the end, under the text ""draw the raised bridge!""
The mural on Scott Street, Wincolmlee, was whitewashed on Sunday night but Jason Fanthorpe used water and white spirit to partly restore the image.
Hull City Council has since installed a large protective cover over the work.
Mr Fanthorpe said he ""could not just sit back and not try to help"" after seeing the mural had been damaged.
""I was just going to bed when I'd seen that it had been painted over, and someone had said it was still wet,"" he said.
""Banksy, love him or hate him, has international prestige and he'd gifted the city with his art.""
A protective screen was installed over the mural on Monday morning
The window cleaner already had his ladders and other equipment prepared for his Monday morning shift, so he headed straight to the bridge in an attempt to save the mural.
He said: ""I tried with just pure water at first, on one tiny corner, desperate not to destroy the underlying art. But it was not shifting so had to use white spirit.""
A number of people also turned up overnight to help with the cleaning, Mr Fanthorpe added.
A steady stream of people have been visiting the street to take photos of the mural after images of it were shared on Banksy's verified Instagram account on Friday.
Hull City Council said the protective layer has been added ""to prevent further damage"".
""This temporary measure will help to ensure that the public can continue to enjoy the work,"" a spokesperson said.
Hundreds of people have visited the mural on Scott Street since it appeared
Staff at the Whalebone pub, yards away from the mural, told the BBC they have met people from Bristol and Manchester who have travelled to Hull specifically to see the artwork.
Chris Fenton went to the site earlier after hearing about the damage.
""Why would someone do that? What was the reason,"" he said.
""All the excitement it brought to the city over the weekend and someone does that.""

"Corey Feldman living in fear after talking to police about sexual abuse claims
Updated 1913 GMT (0313 HKT) November 9, 2017
Corey Feldman tells LAPD about pedophilia claims
Corey Feldman tells LAPD about pedophilia claims
Feldman talked to HLN's Carol Costello
He said he's spoken to the LAPD
As Hollywood grapples with accusations of sexual harassment and abuse, actor Corey Feldman says he's living in fear as he tries to expose pedophilia in the industry.
The actor sat down with HLN's Carol Costello to discuss coming forward to the Los Angeles Police Department with accusations of abuse. The LAPD confirmed it has opened an investigation into Feldman's allegations.
Feldman alleges that both he and his best friend, the late actor Corey Haim, were abused as child stars.
He said it's been an emotional time for him.
""I'd love to give you something juicy, but my nerves are shot,"" Feldman told Costello. ""I'm living in fear, not a good place to be.""

Similarities in Weinstein accusers' stories
""The Goonies"" star said that while he's named names to the police, there is one high-profile name he's not gone public with and that's the person he fears.
Feldman said he gave the police information on that individual, though he was not victimized by him.
""He didn't abuse me, so it's a very tricky situation,"" Feldman said ""I have information about it, but he didn't abuse me.""
Feldman says pedophilia a problem in Hollywood
It's not the first time Feldman has spoken up about pedophilia.
In his 2013 memoir, ""Coreyography,"" the actor wrote: ""The No. 1 problem in Hollywood was, and is, and always will be pedophilia.""
He talked to Costello about the further relief of talking to authorities about what he alleges happened.
""It did feel good to get that off my chest,"" Feldman said. ""Again, so many people in town knew and yet nobody said anything.""
He's planning a film on the issue
has been set up to raise money for a movie Feldman wants to make to expose pedophilia in the industry.
He said he's not gotten support from Hollywood.
""Of all these wealthy actors and producers in Hollywood who have been my friends, taken my side, why has not one of them come up and said, 'Hey, I want to help you get that movie made, here's a donation,'"" Feldman said. ""Not one.""
Spacey allegations: 'Disgusting if it's true,' Feldman says
When it comes to allegations against ""House of Cards"" actor Kevin Spacey -- who actor Anthony Rapp said made a sexual advance toward him in 1986 when he was 14 -- Feldman said, ""I think it's disgusting if it's true.""

Spacey issued a statement claiming he did not recall the incident but apologized for what he said would have been ""inappropriate drunken behavior.""
Feldman said he has some thoughts on how to clean up sexual assault and harassment in Tinsletown.
""I would pre-screen every single writer, producer, director, everyone who came through the studio,"" he said. ""If they have no sexual misconduct, no harassment of children, nothing like that on their record then they're fine to work here. If they have one blemish? They're gone. That's it, out of the business. Period.""

"Alliance leader Naomi Long to undergo surgery
Naomi Long revealed that she has suffered from the condition for most of her adult life
The Alliance party leader has announced that she is due to undergo surgery for endometriosis.
Writing on social media, Naomi Long revealed that she has suffered from the condition for most of her adult life.
She expects to be off work for up to 10 weeks to recover.
In the post she said the operation had originally been scheduled for January but was postponed due to the
The party has said an interim leader will not be appointed during Ms Long's absence.
Ms Long wrote: ""This isn't something I talk about much, but I wanted to let you know what's happening.
""I suffer from very aggressive endometriosis and have done so most of my adult life.
""However, the chronic pain and other symptoms of the condition have become increasingly severe and hard to manage over the last few years.""
Endometriosis is the name given to the condition where cells like the ones in the lining of the womb (uterus) are found elsewhere in the body - including the bowel, ovaries or bladder.
The cells act in the same way as during a period, building up and breaking down.
But they have no way of getting out of the body and can cause inflammation, pain and the formation of scar tissue.
""I've decided that surgery is now the best option,"" she added.
Naomi Long said that she had ""a couple of emergency admissions to hospital"" as a result of the condition.
""I was originally due to be admitted in January - however, due to the collapse of the Assembly and elections, I postponed until April.
""Then the General Election was called, and I had to postpone again for that campaign and the talks process.""
Ms Long said she will also be taking a break from social media while she is ""recuperating"".

"Ariana Grande, Arctic Monkeys and The 1975 prepare new albums for 2018
Musically-speaking, 2017 was a roller coaster.
Ed Sheeran literally broke the charts, a Spanish-language song became the year's biggest single, and Taylor Swift sampled Right Said Fred.
Short of Rihanna covering Deeply Dippy, 2018 can't get any weirder. But what do we have to look forward to?

Remembering One Love Manchester
was undoubtedly changed by
The 24-year-old shouldered the emotional weight of the tragedy for her fans, and staged a defiantly uplifting benefit for the victims that proved pop had the power to heal.
The US star's recently gone back into the studio and it will be interesting to see whether those experiences shape the music on her fourth album.
Grande's long-time manager Scooter Braun hinted at a more mature sound,
: ""She has such an extraordinary voice and it's time for her to sing the songs that define her.""
Pharrell, who is working on the album, added that her new material was ""pretty amazing"".
""The things that she has to say on this album, it's pretty next-level,""
Matty Healy has lofty goals for
's third album, Music For Cars.
""If you look at third albums, OK Computer or The Queen Is Dead, that's what we need to do,""
""I want people to look back and think our records were the most important pop records that a band put out in this decade.""
The star had previously called the album ""the end of an era"" for The 1975, to the horror of fans, who panicked the band were splitting up.
Healy assured them that wasn't the case, telling Apple's radio station Beats 1: ""We were always going to do a trilogy of records. I'm not saying that after this album it's the end of the 1975, but it's definitely the end of an era.""

"Gender pay gap widens for managers
Female managers in the UK earn close to £12,000 less on average than their male counterparts, new research has found.
The gender pay gap for the UK's 3.3 million managers now stands at 26.8%, according to analysis by the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) and XpertHR.
The figure is considerably higher than the average of 18.1% for all workers, or 9.4% for full-time staff.
The CMI report was based on a study of more than 118,000 employees in 423 organisations.
It is based on new reporting requirements and includes salaries and bonuses, as well as benefits such as car allowances and commissions.
The gap last year, under the old rules, stood at at 23.1%.
The gender pay gap is even higher in the Midlands, where male managers earn an average of £42,745 - almost a third more than the £30,038 figure for their female equivalents.
It is also above the national average North and North East of England, where male managers earn an average of 28.8% more than women, while it is lowest in Scotland at 21.5%.
CMI chief executive Ann Francke said: ""Too many businesses are like 'glass pyramids' with women holding the majority of lower-paid junior roles and far fewer reaching the top.
""We now see those extra perks of senior management roles are creating a gender pay gap wider than previously understood.""
She said the figures underlined the need for the government's new
. They require UK companies with more than 250 employees to publish their gender pay gaps within the next year, starting with a snapshot at at 5 April.
Just 77 of the 7,850 employers covered by the new rules have yet done so, the CMI said.
Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson says companies should be fined for failing to report their gender pay gaps
Its research also found that women are far more likely to occupy junior management roles than men (66% compared with 34%), while men hold almost three quarters of senior positions.
At director level positions, the gap widens even further to just over £34,000, with men earning an average of £175,673 and women just £141,529.
Jo Swinson, Liberal Democrat deputy leader and former equalities minister, called on the government to impose ""meaningful sanctions"" for non-compliance.
""The government must commit to bring in penalty fines and naming and shaming for firms who flout the rules. Transparency is an important step, but the focus needs to be on action to close the gender pay gap,"" she said.

"If Germany can't count on old friends, perhaps its time to make new ones
It was no doubt planned many months ago, but the timing of Narendra Modi's short tête-à-tête with Angela Merkel in Berlin on Tuesday will be interpreted as deeply symbolic in Germany and beyond. Could there be something of a pivot to Asia going on in Europe's economic powerhouse?
The Indian prime minister arrived in Europe after what has already been something of a whirlwind few days for Germany's chancellor.
First there was a tense Nato summit in Brussels, followed by, to use Frau Merkel's understated phrasing, a ""very difficult"" G7 summit in Italy, where differences over climate change were particularly apparent.
Then on Sunday, in a Bavarian beer tent, Mrs Merkel made the
that Germany could no longer rely on its long-standing partners - for which read: Brexit-Britain and Donald Trump's America.
It's telling, though, that Mrs Merkel's remarks were covered with more fanfare abroad than they were in the Germany's domestic press, where they were largely recognised as a deft piece of electioneering.
She wants to make clear she's as prepared as anyone else to stand up to Trump, who reitered past criticisms on Tuesday with his tweet: ""We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will change"".
But while things may have come to a head this week, Germany's business community had already been slowly coming to the conclusion that it may - regrettably - be time to seek new friends.
Berlin's old partners are still of supreme importance, of course. Germany exports more to the US and UK than it does to India, China, Korea and Japan combined. And despite the warm handshakes, photo-ops and memorandums of understanding announced this week, the EU is still some distance from signing a free trade agreement with Narendra Modi's government.
But a quick glance at the diary of Germany's economics minister, Brigitte Zypries, or the schedules of some of the country's largest business lobbies tell a different tale: one in which Asian economies are mentioned frequently and enthusiastically, while the US and UK are often referred to in muted, disappointed terms.
You can't move for ""Sino-German"" business conferences in Berlin and Brussels these days, and large, enthusiastic Chinese delegations are a common sight at many of Germany's famous trade fairs. The Chinese premier's visit later this week, comes after years of concerted effort to build ties between Germany, the EU and Xi Jinping's administration.
Yet Germany's eager embrace of rapidly-developing economies has another, less discussed, motive.
The unwelcome truth is that Germany's rather traditional businesses are lagging behind in areas such as digital innovation, and are slow to adapt to the fluid working practices of a globalised world. And when it comes to public investment, Germany is playing catch-up.
Its economy is booming, but much of its infrastructure is crumbling. Its schools are underfunded and it's failing to train enough high-skilled workers - there are hundreds of thousands of professional vacancies at German companies.
Its digital systems are ailing, and in some cases non-existent (particularly in the Mittelstand - medium-sized, often family-owned enterprises).
The so-called ""clean energy transition"" has failed to bring down emissions - the level of greenhouse gasses has actually increased, and Germany still relies heavily on lignite, among the dirtiest of coals. A target to bring one million electric cars to the streets of Germany will almost certainly be missed.
The ""Made in Germany"" brand continues to be damaged by the never-ending ""dieselgate"" saga, over Volkswagen's manipulation of car emissions tests. Unemployment is low, but people in work are paying higher taxes; since 2004, the total number of tax payers paying a rate of 42% has doubled.
These problems are compounded by the country's deep-seated antipathy to debt, at least under the current coalition, which has prioritised balancing the budget over increasing public investment to help with the future-proofing of the German economy.
As Mrs Merkel seeks to be re-elected for a record fourth term, the above issues will serve as ammunition for her opponents, particularly the SPD's Martin Schulz, who will be asking why the benefits of Germany's incessant growth are not as widespread as they could be.
And if the Chancellor is forced to lead from the front in the battle against protectionism, who Germany's friends are, new or old, may turn out to be more significant than expected.

"Tesco is raising store staff pay by 10.5% over two years
Hourly pay rates for Tesco store staff will rise by 10.5% over the next two years, the supermarket has said.
But pay remains lower than at Aldi and Lidl and overtime pay on Sundays and Bank Holidays is being cut.
Currently Tesco workers are paid £7.62 an hour, which will rise to £8.42 an hour by November 2018.
The pay rise will put Tesco workers' pay above the £7.90 level that the National Living Wage
The National Living Wage is the effective minimum wage for adults aged 25 and over, and is currently £7.50.
Those under the age of 25 are entitled to a lower minimum wage rate, whilst workers in London receive a premium.
Statutory minimum pay rates will continue to rise until at least 2020, according to recent government Budgets, and companies are planning for those changes, as well as striving to remain competitive with rivals in order to recruit and retain staff.
Wage growth in the UK has been slow in recent years, but inflation has risen and other supermarkets have increased the wages they pay.
Aldi recently announced a rise in hourly pay to £8.53 an hour; Lidl's website says it pays store staff £8.45 an hour.
Tesco said it would increase hourly pay in three stages: to £8.02 in November 2017, then to £8.18 in July 2018 and to £8.42 in November 2018.
""This reward package sees our biggest investment in store pay for a decade, and gives colleagues a sustainable pay deal that rewards them for everything they do, while allowing us to also attract new talent,"" said Tesco UK chief executive, Matt Davies.
The retailer said maternity pay terms had also been improved. But extra pay for Sundays and bank holidays will be reduced from time-and-a-half to time-and-a-quarter after July 2018.
""This is designed to meet the government legislative requirement around the minimum wage.
""As expected, most of the businesses who have had to face up to this rise have had to reduce premiums and other perks that employees benefitted from in order to meet the core wage rises,"" said retail analyst Steve Dresser.

"Grenfell Tower charity single released
Ella Eyre, Louisa Johnson and Stormzy were all involved in the recording
A single to raise money for those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire has been released.
Stars including Stormzy, Robbie Williams, Celine Dion and Liam Payne recorded
to help raise money for those affected.
The cover of the Simon and Garfunkel classic, also featuring Craig David and Skepta, was organised by Simon Cowell.
, following the fire in west London a week ago.
Cowell lives in the same London borough as Grenfell Tower and announced the single last Thursday.
The song opens with a verse by Stormzy, who says: ""I don't know where to begin / So I'll start by saying I refuse to forget you.
""I refuse to be silenced / I refuse to neglect you.""
The London-born MC goes on to say, ""That could have been my mum's house / Or that could have been my nephew"", concluding, ""I just hope that you're resting and free up there"".
Others performing include music legends Sir Paul McCartney, Brian May and Roger Daltry, with lines also sung by Rita Ora, Pixie Lott, Ella Eyre and Paloma Faith.
Payne's One Direction bandmate Louis Tomlinson has also loaned his vocals to the track.
Kelly Jones, Pixie Lott and Paloma Faith - Jones said the choice of song was ""apt""
The song, first released by the American folk duo in 1970, contains lyrics including: ""When you're weary, feeling small / When tears are in your eyes, I'll dry them all / I'm on your side.""
Stereophonics singer Kelly Jones said the choice of song was ""very apt"", adding: ""All these things that are happening in London at the minute, and Manchester and everywhere, I think the main thing is people are pulling together.""
X Factor winner Louisa Johnson said she felt ""honoured"" to be involved with the ""beautiful"" single, which is also to feature local choirs.
Emeli Sande, who has just been made an MBE, said: ""I hope it shows the power of community and the strength of people.
""That is the beauty of London, the integration makes it so incredible.""
Pianist Tokio Myers, who recently won Britain's Got Talent, has also recorded part of the single, as have Bastille, James Blunt and Dua Lipa.
The devastating blaze took place a week ago
The London Community Gospel Choir took part too, with Pitch Battle's Gareth Malone leading a local community choir.
Meanwhile, West End stars are taking part in a benefit concert next week. Dame Judi Dench, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Harry Potter And The Cursed Child's Noma Dumezweni will be among those taking part in the event at Trafalgar Studios in London.

"Police calls for mental health issues up by a third
Calls to the Metropolitan Police about mental health have risen by almost a third in five years, figures show.
There were 115,000 calls with a mental health element to London's police force in the 12 months to July.
That compares to 86,520 in 2011-12 and equates to about 315 a day.
Call-outs included to people involved in or suspected of crime, those in crisis, support to other emergency services and local council health assessments.
Forty thousand of the calls had a police unit assigned - or sent out - to them, the detail showed.
The calls were a mixture of emergency 999 and 101 calls.
Of those, 13,000 related to mental health hospitals, of which 4,000 have a unit assigned.
The Met received almost five million 999 and 101 calls in the same period.
Commander Richard Smith, head of safeguarding at the Metropolitan Police Service, said one-in-four Londoners would experience ""a diagnosable mental health condition"" in their lifetime and that included the ""large number of people"" held in custody who would need an assessment and a care plan.
Use of Section 136 of the Mental Health Act was also up - the emergency police power to take someone into a safe place when they are out in public.
Police said it was up about 10 per cent each year, and could double in London during the next 10 years.
The Met can take up to 400 people detained under section 136 to a place of safety each month.
Labour's police spokeswoman Louise Haigh MP said people on long waiting lists for mental health help were turning to the police as a service of last resort.
""While facing a savage cut in numbers the police are increasingly being asked to pick up the pieces of a scandalous lack of mental health provision,"" she said.
A Department of Health spokesperson said there had been ""major improvements"" to mental health support in recent years - including setting up access and waiting standards and increasing spending to Â£11.6bn in 2016/17.
But the spokesperson said there was ""more to do"" and the government was working with NHS England to improve access to services across the country.

"Despacito breaks global streaming record
Despacito: The Latin hit taking over the world
Luis Fonsi's Despacito has become the most-streamed song of all time, just six months after it was released.
has been played 4.6 billion times across all streaming services, overtaking Justin Bieber's Sorry, which previously held the title.
""What's happened with this song is just insane,"" said Fonsi, who hails from Puerto Rico and sings in Spanish.
""I don't want to use the word accident because I was trying to write a hit, but I didn't plan for it to cross over.
""I just wanted to make people dance.""
The 39-year-old said the global success of his song - which has reached number one in 35 countries, including the UK - gave him hope in the current political climate.
""I come from Puerto Rico and I live in Miami. We're living in an interesting time right now when people want to divide us. They want to build walls.
""And for a song to bring people and cultures together, that's what makes me proud.""
The original version of the song was entirely in Spanish, juxtaposing Fonsi's melodic chorus with Daddy Yankee's more gritty, urban verses
Most streamed songs of all time
Despacito (ft Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber)
Despacito is a sun-bleached slice of sensual reggaeton. The title translates as ""slowly"", referring to the speed of Fonsi's seduction technique.
It hit number one around Latin America when it was released in January, but only caught fire in the English-speaking world after Justin Bieber heard the song in a nightclub and asked to add a verse.
His version of the song - known as
- has become a phenomenon on streaming services, most notably Spotify and Apple Music. It is already the fourth most-played video of all time on YouTube, where it is rapidly closing in on the top three, all of which are years old.
The head of Universal Music Group, Sir Lucian Grainge, said the success of Despacito showed how streaming was democratising the music market.
""Streaming has allowed a song with a different beat, from a different culture, in a different language, to become this juggernaut of success and pleasure,"" he told the BBC.
""The industry has predominantly been English-speaking artists for the last 50 years [but] streaming will continue to open up music from Latin America artists globally.
""Anything and everywhere is up for grabs.""
Justin Bieber liked the song so much, he offered to perform on a remix
Of course, records will continue to be broken alongside the growth of streaming services - which give users access to a vast library of on-demand music for a monthly fee.
In March, Spotify announced it had attracted 50 million subscribers. Apple Music, which is yet to reach its second birthday, has already attracted 27 million paying customers; while Google Play, Amazon Unlimited, Deezer and YouTube and dozens of others have contributed to Despacito's success.
Critics might point out that the song would never have achieved such visibility without Bieber's contribution, but Sir Lucian was candid about how Universal had harnessed the star's brand power.
""Bringing in Justin Bieber meant that we could take something that was well on its way, and really take it to heights that would have been perceived as unimaginable when the song was written,"" he told the BBC.
""We were at one level, and he helped us get to the next.""
Fonsi also paid tribute to Bieber's contribution, and reflected on his breathtaking success in a phone interview from Lisbon.
Hi Luis! How does it feel to have the most-streamed song in history?
It's been an incredible ride. Pretty much from the start it has just been crazy. Obviously it was a snowball effect. It started first with my more traditional market - the Latin American market. But we had an instant response. I got phone calls congratulating me from people who don't normally call.
Is it a source of pride that Despacito is predominantly a Spanish-language song?
Yeah, that's the beauty behind it. The original version, which I did just with Daddy Yankee, was in Spanish then four months later, Justin Bieber jumps in [and] adds a verse at the beginning in English.
It was his choice to keep the chorus in Spanish - because we had an English lyric for it - but he wanted to stay true to the original version.
Now I'm getting videos from different parts of the world, listening to people trying to nail the Spanish, trying to learn a bit of Spanish through the song.
Before the global success of Despacito, Fonsi had scored six number one singles in Latin America
Have you forgiven Justin for
when he performed it live? (The singer sang ""burrito"" and ""dorito"" instead of the Spanish lyrics)
Yeah, you know, it's not his language. If he was saying he could speak Spanish and he couldn't, I'd be like, ""Hey man"". But I don't think he's ever come out and said he's a Spanish-speaker. He just wanted to do the song because he loved it. And I think you have to tip your hat to him, because he took the time to phonetically learn the chorus in Spanish.
I know that that takes time [because] I've actually done the song in different languages myself. I've just done the song in Portuguese, and Portuguese is very similar to Spanish, but it was very hard for me to nail that version. And if you were to ask me to sing it now in Portuguese, I wouldn't have a clue where to start!
So I think we just have to let it go.
Why has it become so popular?
This is a question I've been asked a lot but, for some reason, I don't have the perfect answer for it. I think it's the sum of lots of little things.
Obviously, it's a very catchy melody. The way the chorus starts
is very easy to remember. And it's almost impossible not to move when you hear the track, even if you're not a dancer. And obviously you add Justin Bieber to that, and it brings another angle to all of this.
But I wish I knew exactly what the secret was, so I could apply it to all my future songs!
What is the strangest place you've heard it?
It probably hasn't been anywhere too strange - but you walk into a restaurant, or you're at a traffic light and the car next to you is listening to itâ€¦ It's just insane! I can't help but smile.

Yeah, you know what? I'm compiling a bunch of footage and audio from all the different versions that have been done in all the different languages and I want to edit it together. It's so amazing. It makes me proud that the world's coming together.
I come from Puerto Rico and I live in Miami. We're living in an interesting time right now when people want to divide us, they want to build walls, and for a song to bring people and cultures together, I think that's what makes me proud. Music has that power. It might sound cheesy but I do believe music brings us together.
Did you see that Canadian PM Justin Trudeau put you on his
Oh really, I didn't know that! That guy has good taste!
How can you ever top something like this?
Oh, you don't. This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I don't want to be a pessimist about it. I don't want to be negative about it. But my next song, I can't approach it thinking, ""How do I beat Despacito?""
Do you really expect to win the lottery twice? We just have to be grateful for what we've done and go forward.

"General election 2017: David Dimbleby to host programme
In 2015, the BBC praised the ""experienced team"" leading the election programme
David Dimbleby is to host the BBC's 2017 general election programme.
News presenter Huw Edwards had been expected to front the show after Dimbleby said 2015 would be his final time presenting the results coverage.
It will be the 78-year-old's 10th time hosting the programme, having first fronted it in 1979 when Margaret Thatcher became prime minister.
The programme on 8 June will run through the night.
Ahead of the 2015 general election, director of BBC News, James Harding, had said it would be Dimbleby's last as lead anchor, with Edwards set to front the show thereafter.
When Dimbleby's 2015 overnight stint finished, Edwards took over as presenter from 07:00.
Edwards also hosted the Scottish independence referendum results programme from Glasgow.

"Drake offers fans a stake in Virginia Black whiskey
Business reporter, New York
Drake takes a shot of Virginia Black at the Billboard awards last year
stakes in his whiskey business, raising as much as $30m (£22.2m) to expand the company.
The move comes over a year after the first sales of Virginia Black, which Drake started with the founder of DeLeon Tequila.
The partners say the stock offering is more about raising awareness of the brand than cash.
Would-be investors must spend a minimum of $100 to participate.
The Virginia Black sale will start in the first quarter through a type of crowd-sourced stock sale open to anyone.
Co-founder Brent Hocking said the company did not need to raise money.
""Everyone in this deal is well-financed,"" Mr Hocking said. ""This offering is more of Drake giving an opportunity for all of his fans to come and be a part of this with him and to create a large group of brand ambassadors that can be proud that they own a piece of Virginia Black.""
US regulators in 2015 paved the way for
that Virginia Black plans to use in a bid to help smaller companies.
The process does not carry the same rules for public communications as other kinds of public offerings, said Mark Elenowitz the chief executive of TriPoint Global Equities, which is underwriting the Virginia Black offering.
He said his firm is talking to ""a lot"" of celebrity-linked firms about the process.
In the case of Virginia Black, Mr Elenowitz said: ""What draws us is not the celebrity, but rather the deal.""
Drake performs in Las Vegas
Mr Hocking declined to reveal details about Virginia Black's revenue and profits but said 60,000 cases of the Indiana-made whiskey had been sold in about 15 months.
A 750ml bottle, which has rye flavour and has a mild flavour intended for mass appeal, costs about $40 in the US or £40 in the UK.
sold about 12.5m cases in 2017, while Woodford Reserve brand sold 600,000.
Virginia Black launched an advertising campaign late last year, but Drake is yet to publicise the offering on his popular social media accounts.
Mr Hocking said that came as no surprise: ""He's up in the studio, late night working.""

"James Dreyfus pulls out of play on medical advice
Dreyfus had been due to play Paul opposite Samantha Bond's Alice
Actor James Dreyfus has pulled out of a London play on medical advice.
The Gimme Gimme Gimme star had been due to star as Samantha Bond's husband in The Lie by France's Florian Zeller.
His role at the Menier Chocolate Factory in south London will now be played by Alexander Hanson, Bond's real-life husband.
The play was due to begin its run this week but is likely to have some of its preview performances cancelled. Ticket holders will be notified.
Hanson was previously seen at the Menier in The Truth, another Zeller play. The Lie is a companion piece to that 2011 work.
Dreyfus's departure comes in the wake of another exit from a high-profile London production, again on medical advice.
Sarah Lancashire had been due to appear opposite Martin Freeman in Labour of Love, a play about divisions within the Labour Party.
Her role will instead be played by Tamsin Greig when James Graham's drama opens at the Noel Coward theatre at the end of September.

"Once-a-week pill for HIV 'ready for testing in people'
The once-a-week pill would look much like any other regular drug capsule
Human trials of a once-a-week oral pill for HIV can start, after successful tests in pigs, say US scientists.
The slow-release tablet could free patients from having to take daily medication, they say.
It looks like a normal capsule, but on reaching the stomach its coating dissolves and a special structure packed inside unfolds.
This 4cm (1.5in) star-shaped scaffold stays in the stomach for seven days, steadily releasing its cargo of drugs.
The star is too large to move out of the stomach but still allows food to journey through to the small intestine.
Once it has delivered its payload, the star begins to degrade and passes on through the digestive tract.
In the pig trial, the researchers dosed it with enough of three antiretroviral drugs - dolutegravir, rilpivirine and cabotegravir - to last for seven days.
The researchers say, in the future, the oral drug delivery device could be used for a wide range of diseases, not just HIV.
Preliminary tests in pigs have already been done with a malaria drug called ivermectin and the star remaining in the stomach for up to two weeks.
Researcher Giovanni Traverso, from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Brigham and Women's Hospital in the US, said: ""We wanted to come up with a system to make it easier for patients to stick to taking their treatments.
""Changing a medication so it only needs to be taken once a week rather than once a day should be more convenient and improve compliance.
""Once-a-month formulations might even be possible for some diseases.""
A company called Lyndra is now developing the technology and plans human trials of the long-lasting oral delivery pills within the next 12 months. Tests with HIV medication could begin after that, subject to approval.
Dr Traverso said: ""There are lots of patients this could help, including people with dementia or mental health disorders such as schizophrenia.""
Some slow-release drugs could already be given by injection, he said.
A Terrence Higgins Trust representative said: ""Medical advances have come on leaps and bounds for HIV in the UK in recent years, however we do know that taking a pill each day does present practical barriers for some people living with HIV.
""We welcome the prospect of a treatment that removes these barriers, and presents all people living with HIV with further choice, provided that it is no less effective than current options available.""
The HIV research, published in the journal
, was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the Brigham and Women's Hospital.

"Borrow more to boost building, says Sajid Javid
The housing crisis should be tackled by borrowing more to fund construction, a senior cabinet minister has said.
Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said taking advantage of record-low interest rates ""can be the right thing if done sensibly"".
The housing crisis Britain faced was ""the biggest barrier to social progress in our country today"", he told the BBC.
The Budget on 22 November would contain more on housing policy, Mr Javid said.
""We are looking at new investments and there will be announcements.""
, in which he has called on the industry to offer solutions to the home-buying and selling process.
Speaking to BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid said he wanted to ""make sure that we're using everything we have available to deal with this housing crisis"".
He said between 275,000 and 300,000 homes a year were needed in England alone to help tackle the shortage in affordable housing.
""So for example... you borrow more to invest in the infrastructure that leads to more housing - take advantage of some of the record-low interest rates that we have. I think we should absolutely be considering that.""
He added he would ""make a distinction between the deficit, which needs to come down - and that's vitally important for our economic credibility...
""But investing for the future, taking advantage of record-low interest rates, can be the right thing if done sensibly. And that can help, not just with the housing itself, but one of the big issues is infrastructure investment that is needed alongside the housing.""
Theresa May pledged at the Conservative Party conference this month to fix the housing crisis, as she announced an extra Â£2bn for affordable housing to build an additional 25,000 social homes.

"Stormzy sings at fan's father's funeral
The star gave up his free time to perform at the funeral
Stormzy has turned up to perform at the funeral of a fan's father after spotting a message on Twitter.
Nasir Bockarie's father died in the Royal Berkshire Hospital on 8 December, the day Nasir graduated.
He sent Stormzy a message saying he and his father had both loved the song Blinded By Your Grace, and invited him to sing at the funeral.
""Don't worry if you can't,"" he added. ""I just thought I'd try my luck"". To his surprise, Stormzy replied.
Bro my Dad passed away on the day of my graduation last week Friday. Our favourite song of yours was blinded by your grace. Would love it if you could preform this at his funeral next Thursday 21st December. Donâ€™t worry if you canâ€™t, I just thought Iâ€™d try my luck ğŸ™ğŸ¾

After they exchanged private messages, Nasir posted a message saying: ""All done bro! I'm actually speechless, praise god for humanity.""
His cousin, Mariama Kallon,
that she was ""in shock"" after finding out about the star's generosity.
""I don't want to hear any slander about this man ever because I don't know many people who have a soul to match his,"" she wrote.
The funeral took place in Reading on 21 December and, sure enough, Stormzy kept his promise.

After the service, one of the mourners

""Massive respect for @Stormzy1 for honouring this,"" he added. ""God Bless You.""
Ms Kallon told the BBC that Stormzy had arrived with ""a few members of his team"" and performed Blinded By Your Grace, ""a family favourite"".
""Family events for us are very special, whether it be a funeral or wedding,"" she added.
""We try to find the positive out of everything and that can be hard at funerals, especially with younger family members.
""We did the best to give my uncle a memorable send-off and of course Stormzy really made that happen.
""We're so grateful and our family will be praying for him always.""
A publicist for Stormzy confirmed to the BBC that he had attended the service.

"Equifax says almost 400,000 Britons hit in data breach
The massive data breach is being investigated by US and UK data watchdogs
Data about British people ""may potentially have been accessed"" during the data breach at the US credit rating firm Equifax.
The UK arm of the organisation said files containing information on ""fewer than 400,000"" UK consumers was accessed in the breach.
Last week, Equifax revealed details of the hack and said data on more than 143 million Americans was taken.
The US Federal Trade Commission is investigating how the data was stolen.
Information released when details of the breach were disclosed suggest that hackers got at Equifax's internal systems between mid-May and the end of July this year when the company discovered it had been penetrated.
Data on social security numbers, birth dates and addresses, was taken during the incident.
Equifax is now facing dozens of legal claims over the incident.
In a statement, the UK office of Equifax said an internal investigation had shown that data on UK consumers was accessed during the hack.
It said data on Britons was being held in the US due to a ""process failure"" which meant that a limited amount of information was stored in North America between 2011 and 2016.
The information held included names, dates of birth, email addresses and telephone numbers. No addresses, passwords or financial data was involved.
Equifax said that because the data on UK citizens was limited it was ""unlikely"" that those affected would suffer identity theft.
It said it would contact those affected and offer them free ID protection services that would alert them to any attempt to carry out fraud with their details.
""We apologise for this failure to protect UK consumer data,"" said Patricio Remon, president at Equifax's UK office, in the statement.
""Our immediate focus is to support those affected by this incident and to ensure we make all of the necessary improvements and investments to strengthen our security and processes going forward,"" he added.
It said it was co-operating with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Information Commissioner's Office on their investigations.

"What being a mum taught Suranne Jones about Doctor Foster
Suranne Jones returns to her role as Dr Gemma Foster after two years
A lot has changed for Suranne Jones since we last saw her in Bafta-winning TV series Doctor Foster, in which she plays a GP who suspects her husband is cheating on her.
Two years down the line, Jones has now become a mother - and says this has given her a new awareness of what mum-of-one Gemma Foster went through.
""Being a wife and a mother made me realise the gravitas of that unit falling apart, because I'd go home at night and I'd have a baby to put to bed,"" she says.
""So I think it definitely made me realise when two people get together and have a child out of love and then they split... what it is to parent a child and be in each other's lives when you are damaged and hurt without damaging and hurting a child.""
Jones brought her son to set (""on camera he looked much better than I did"", she jokes) but is looking forward to some down time with him.
""The work/life balance for anyone is hard, so I try to keep work separate,"" she explains.
""I feel very, very grateful because I did a lot of work and now I'm taking a lot of time off. So I'm there until Christmas now, just down the play park in my Converse.""
The second series of the BBC One drama takes up the action as Gemma's estranged husband Simon (Bertie Carvel) and his new family return to the fictional town of Parminster, where she lives and works.
They are dealing with the bitter repercussions of divorce - with their son, Tom, caught in the middle.
One promotional image shows Gemma Foster with a wound where her wedding ring should be
Jones admits it can be ""uncomfortable"" viewing at times but says the show has a ""weird, sexy edge to it"".
""We all know what it feels like to be in a room with an ex-partner,"" she goes on.
""Everybody has had a relationship, everyone has had exes, everybody has been in difficult circumstances. I'm sure myself and Bertie have had those thoughts and feelings; otherwise we wouldn't be able to draw on them.
""But at the same time, with the style of writing and the style of the programme, you're able to go further.
""It has a fantastical edge as well as being deep-rooted in naturalism. It also has an exaggerated way of showing how far you could go if you really wanted to.""
It's safe to say it wasn't an amicable break-up for Gemma and Simon Foster
Carvel, who played Miss Trunchbull in West End musical Matilda, says he found Mike Bartlett's writing ""exciting"" and that the Doctor Foster plot was a ""real page-turner"".
""He gives us incredibly three-dimensional characters"", says the actor, adding that it was ""really fun"" to play a character who makes the audience change their opinion about him as the drama progresses.
""Often you find yourself looking at something from a really different point of view,"" he says. ""That's what's exciting about this series as a whole.""
Jones says the original plan was to give Gemma a new look. After conducting a screen test, though, it was agreed that it just didn't work.
""She's moved on, but actually she's comfortable with her bob and her work and she's put up her walls,"" says the former Coronation Street actress.
""It was the right decision to move her on but leave her embalmed in a way.
""And what I got, as well as being exciting and dark and sexy and thrilling and all those things, I looked at them both and thought, 'You're both really hurt' and I hadn't seen that before.""
The Doctor Foster team were going to give Gemma a new look but instead left her ""embalmed""
Bartlett - the man behind award-winning play King Charles III, recently filmed by the BBC - says he originally intended Doctor Foster to have a single series.
""But when we were shooting it, I started to realise there could more - there could be another story or a further story to tell,"" he explains.
The first series' final scene saw Gemma and her son together, seeing her former husband with his pregnant new partner.
""It looks like a happy ending, but there are lots of threads untied"", Bartlett goes on.
""There's more to tell, so when we had the opportunity, I thought we should.""
Doctor Foster returns to BBC One next month.

"Facebook bans rapper Lil B for 'hate speech' posts
Lil B is known for espousing greater tolerance and positivity between races
US rapper Lil B, known for his outspoken views on social media, is facing a 30-day ban under Facebook's hate speech policies.
The musician has expressed anger over the suspension and fans have criticised the ban on Twitter.
Facebook said some of his posts violated its policies on hate speech.
The posts, according to publications with which he later shared the messages, related to white people and gun violence.
republished two of the banned posts.
They read: ""White people are the only ones who really love they guns U can tell they are violent people! I don't live in fear I don't need a gun - Lil B.""
""White people so scared they the reason why guns are a problem if white people put down the gunze we all be safe but nope! They vilent - Lil B.""
In 2014, Lil B faced a similar ban.
Facebook is not commenting on the current suspension but the BBC understands that the rapper is alleged to have violated its hate speech policies a number of times.
The social media's community standards page includes a section on reporting abuse and states that the consequences for violating its standards will vary depending on the severity of the violation.
In an interview with tech website
, a Facebook spokeswoman defended its decision saying that the site's hate speech policies apply equally to all races and are ""race-neutral"".

Thirty-six people have been charged for their alleged involvement in running a cyber-crime service responsible for more than $530m (Â£381m) of losses.

Other defendants include Svyatoslav Bondarenko, a Ukranian accused of having created Infraud in October 2010.
Five apprehended defendants were based in the US while others came from France, Canada, Pakistan, Russia Egypt, Italy and Macedonia among other countries.
""As alleged in the indictment, Infraud operated like a business to facilitate cyber-fraud on a global scale,"" said acting assistant attorney general John Cronan of the Justice Department's Criminal Division.

"Kobe Steel chief Hiroya Kawasaki quits after data scandal
The chief executive of Japan's Kobe Steel has resigned in the aftermath of a data falsification scandal.
Hiroya Kawasaki said he would step down, as the firm released a long-awaited report into the wrongdoing.
It confirmed that staff had changed or made up data on the quality of some of its products before they were shipped.
Kobe Steel had ""deep-seated issues"" around corporate culture and compliance, the report admitted.
""For over 112 years since its founding, the Kobe Steel group has managed its business and has conducted its business by valuing the trust of its customers,"" it said.
""The recent loss of such trust is truly regrettable.""
Kobe said the departure of Mr Kawasaki, as well as executive vice president Akira Kaneka, reflected ""the company taking to heart the troubles we have caused our customers, suppliers, shareholders and many other people in connection with the misconduct that took place"".
Mr Kawasaki personally apologised in a media conference, saying he would leave the post on 1 April and allow a new leadership to make reforms.
Kobe Steel is Japan's third-largest steelmaker, and supplies manufacturers of cars, planes, trains and other products around the world.
Manufacturers such as General Motors, Boeing and Toyota have been investigating whether they have used any of the sub-standard materials - though no safety issues have yet been reported.
Kobe Steel is just one in a string of major Japanese companies to be mired in scandal.
They include cases of falsified data at Nissan Motors, Subaru and Mitsubishi Motors.
