Devices, systems, and methods of detecting user identity, differentiating between users of a computerized service, and detecting a possible attacker. A log-in process or a user-authentication process, is augmented or enriched by one or more incidental tasks, which force the user to perform additional on-screen interactions or input-unit interactions, which in turn enrich and augment the pool of user interactions from which the system extracts one or more user-specific features. The extracted user-specific features are used as part of the user authentication process, and are further used to differentiate among users.

An end-user device (a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a smartphone, a tablet, or the like) interacts and communicates with a server of a computerized server (a banking website, an electronic commerce website, or the like). The interactions are monitored, tracked and logged. User Interface (UI) interferences are intentionally introduced to the communication session; and the server tracks the response or the reaction of the end-user to such communication interferences. The system determines whether the user is a legitimate human user; or a cyber-attacker posing as the legitimate human user. The system displays gauges indicating cyber fraud scores or cyber-attack threat-levels. The system extrapolates from observed fraud incidents and utilizes a rules engine to automatically search for similar fraud events and to automatically detect fraud events or cyber-attackers.

To make a payment, a smartphone presents artwork for a payment card (e.g., a Visa card) that has been selected by a user from a virtual wallet of such cards. Encoded in the displayed artwork is payment information that has been encrypted with a context-dependent session key. A cooperating system (e.g., a retailer's point of sale system) uses a camera to capture an image of the artwork, and independently creates the session key from its own context sensor(s), enabling decryption of the payment information. Such technology provides a superior transaction security model at a fraction of the cost of competing chip card payment systems (which require, e.g., expensive physical cards, and single-purpose reader hardware). A great variety of other features and arrangements are also detailed.

The probability of each substring occurring within a malware family is determined and a decision tree is constructed using the substrings. An enterprise server receives indications from client machines that a particular file is suspected of being malware. The suspect file is retrieved and the decision tree is walked using the suspect file. A leaf node is reached that identifies a particular common substring, a byte offset within the suspect file at which it is likely that the common substring begins, and a probability distribution that the common substring appears in a number of malware families. A hash value of the common substring is compared (exact or approximate) against the corresponding substring in the suspect file. If positive, a result is returned to the enterprise server indicating the probability that the suspect file is a member of a particular malware family.

A control unit can receive a first, dirty feature vector (e.g., a false miss) and determine the local CM based on the first feature vector. The control unit can receive a trial feature vector representing the trial data stream. The control unit can determine that the trial data stream is dirty if a broad CM or the local CM determines that the trial feature vector is dirty. In some examples, the local CM can define a dirty region in a feature space. The control unit can determine the local CM based on the first feature vector and other clean or dirty feature vectors, e.g., a clean feature vector nearest to the first feature vector.

A threat management facility generates a simulated phishing threat based on one or more characteristics of a network user. Based on whether the user fails to respond appropriately to the simulated phishing threat, the threat management facility may implement one or more prophylactic measures to remediate the security weakness exposed by the user's failure to respond appropriately to the simulated phishing threat. For example, a security policy for an endpoint associated with the user may be adjusted to address the security weakness.

By tracking such data for various computing objects and correlating these labels to malware occurrences, rules can be written for distribution to endpoints to facilitate threat detection based on, e.g., interactions of labeled objects, changes to object labels, and so forth.

Threat detection instrumentation is simplified by providing and updating labels for computing objects in a context-sensitive manner. This may include simple labeling schemes to distinguish between objects, e.g., trusted/untrusted processes or corporate/private data. This may also include more granular labeling schemes such as a three-tiered scheme that identifies a category (e.g., financial, e-mail, game), static threat detection attributes (e.g., signatures, hashes, API calls), and explicit identification (e.g., what a file or process calls itself). By tracking such data for various computing objects and correlating these labels to malware occurrences, rules can be written for distribution to endpoints to facilitate threat detection based on, e.g., interactions of labeled objects, changes to object labels, and so forth. In this manner, threat detection based on complex interactions of computing objects can be characterized in a platform independent manner and pre-processed on endpoints without requiring significant communications overhead with a remote threat management facility.

A threat management facility analyzes a plurality of instructions in computer code for redundancy. When redundancy is found, the threat management facility determines whether the redundancy has characteristics of deliberate obfuscation consistent with malware techniques such as server-side polymorphism. Measures of redundancy, such as one or more of a degree of redundancy or a pattern of redundancy, may inform this process, and my usefully aid in distinguishing legitimate code redundancies from malware. Where an inference of malware is supported, the threat management facility may initiate remediation of the computer code.

The disclosed techniques relate to a graph-based network security analytic framework to combine multiple sources of information and security knowledge in order to detect risky behaviors and potential threats. In some examples, the input can be anomaly events or simply regular events. The entities associated with the activities can be grouped into smaller time units, e.g., per day. The riskiest days of activity can be found by computing a risk score for each day and according to the features in the day. A graph can be built with links between the time units. The links can also receive scoring based on a number of factors. The resulting graph can be compared with known security knowledge for adjustments. Threats can be detected based on the adjusted risk score for a component (i.e., a group of linked entities) as well as a number of other factors.

Techniques and mechanisms are disclosed to increase the availability of summary data within a clustered data intake and query system by replicating the summary data within the cluster. In general, summary data may store pre-computed results for one or more search queries and can be used by indexers of a cluster to process subsequent instances of the same search queries. At a high level, replication of summary data within a cluster may include ensuring that each instance of summary data created by an indexer of a cluster is replicated to other indexers within the cluster that store copies of the same grouped subset(s) of data to which the summary data relates. In this manner, if one or more indexers of an indexer cluster fail, other indexers of the cluster can make immediate use of replicated copies of the summary data without re-creating it.

Next, the system obtains, from the remote system, a response to the request, wherein the response includes the local time of the remote system. The system then computes a difference between the time of transmission and the local time of the remote system to determine a time offset that accounts for a time difference between the computer system and the remote system. Finally, the system uses the time offset to standardize timestamps in time-series data received from the remote system, wherein standardizing the timestamps associated with the time-series data comprises adjusting the timestamps to conform to a time standard.

An improved method and system for processing network metadata is described. Network metadata may be processed by dynamically instantiated executable software modules which make policy-based decisions about the character of the network metadata and about presentation of the network metadata to consumers of the information carried by the network metadata. The network metadata may be type classified and each subclass within a type may be mapped to a definition by a unique fingerprint value. The fingerprint value may be used for matching the network metadata subclasses against relevant policies and transformation rules. For template-based network metadata such as NetFlow v9, an embodiment of the invention can constantly monitor network traffic for unknown templates, capture template definitions, and informs administrators about templates for which custom policies and conversion rules do not exist. Conversion modules can efficiently convert selected types and/or subclasses of network metadata into alternative metadata formats.

A method for detecting intrusions into an onboard network of vehicle controllers includes determining the current state of operation of a vehicle, and identifying a network traffic pattern table corresponding to the vehicle's current state of operation. Network traffic flow for one of the in- vehicle controllers is monitored when exchanging data over the Ethernet communication interface while the motor vehicle is operating in the current state of operation. The method then determines if a traffic characteristic of the monitored network traffic flow is outside a calibrated boundary that is determined from the network traffic pattern table. Responsive to the monitored network traffic flow characteristic being outside the calibrated boundary, the method executes a remedial action response.

A method for fetching a content from a web server to a client device is disclosed, using tunnel devices serving as intermediate devices. The client device accesses an acceleration server to receive a list of available tunnel devices. The requested content is partitioned into slices, and the client device sends a request for the slices to the available tunnel devices. The tunnel devices in turn fetch the slices from the data server, and send the slices to the client device, where the content is reconstructed from the received slices. A client device may also serve as a tunnel device, serving as an intermediate device to other client devices. Similarly, a tunnel device may also serve as a client device for fetching content from a data server. The selection of tunnel devices to be used by a client device may be in the acceleration server, in the client device, or in both. The partition into slices may be overlapping or non-overlapping, and the same slice (or the whole content) may be fetched via multiple tunnel devices.

Methods and apparatus for efficient data transfer within a user space network stack. Unlike prior art monolithic networking stacks, the exemplary networking stack architecture described hereinafter includes various components that span multiple domains (both in-kernel, and non-kernel). For example, unlike traditional socket based communication, disclosed embodiments can transfer data directly between the kernel and user space domains. Direct transfer reduces the per-byte and per-packet costs relative to socket based communication. A user space networking stack is disclosed that enables extensible, cross-platform-capable, user space control of the networking protocol stack functionality. The user space networking stack facilitates tighter integration between the protocol layers (including TLS) and the application or daemon. Exemplary systems can support multiple networking protocol stack instances (including an in-kernel traditional network stack).

An online index of websites that leverages generic top-level domain extension names as an intuitive nomenclature with which to index websites using a website template or plug-in. The website template or plug-in and associated software accesses the consolidated data of the indexed websites into a virtual database and synchronizes the data to a user's hardware wallet which operates an exchange software program forming a decentralized exchange enabling transactions to be settled off-line and peer-to-peer which are then recorded onto a distributed ledger or block-chain.
