Devices, systems, and methods of detecting user identity, differentiating between users of a computerized service, and detecting a possible attacker. A log-in process or a user-authentication process, is augmented or enriched by one or more incidental tasks, which force the user to perform additional on-screen interactions or input-unit interactions, which in turn enrich and augment the pool of user interactions from which the system extracts one or more user-specific features. The extracted user-specific features are used as part of the user authentication process, and are further used to differentiate among users.

An end-user device (a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a smartphone, a tablet, or the like) interacts and communicates with a server of a computerized server (a banking website, an electronic commerce website, or the like). The interactions are monitored, tracked and logged. User Interface (UI) interferences are intentionally introduced to the communication session; and the server tracks the response or the reaction of the end-user to such communication interferences. The system determines whether the user is a legitimate human user; or a cyber-attacker posing as the legitimate human user. The system displays gauges indicating cyber fraud scores or cyber-attack threat-levels. The system extrapolates from observed fraud incidents and utilizes a rules engine to automatically search for similar fraud events and to automatically detect fraud events or cyber-attackers.

A system manages computer security risks associated with message file attachments. When a user of an electronic device with a messaging client attempts to open an attachment to a message that is in the client's inbox, the system will analyze the message to determine whether the message is a legitimate message or a potentially malicious message without the need to actually process or analyze the attachment itself. If the system determines that the received message is a legitimate message, the system will permit the attachment to actuate on the client computing device. If the system determines that the received message is not or may not be a legitimate message, the system will continue preventing the attachment from actuating on the client computing device.

Diversity information associated with a set of advertisement tags is determined. Example ways of determining diversity include determining a list of distinct Uniform Resource Locators, determining a list of distinct domains, and determining whether an advertisement includes one or more dynamic elements. Scans are adaptively performed based on the determined diversity information. Scanning is performed more frequently for advertisement tags having higher associated diversities and scanning is performed less frequently for advertisement tags having lower associated diversities.

A client electronic device of an electronic message analysis system receives a user activation action indicating that a user has reported a message received at the client device a potentially malicious. The client device then determines whether to forward the message to a remote service for analysis by assessing whether the received message originated from a trusted sender. If and only if the client device determines that the received message originated from a trusted sender, it will permit the client device to take other action on the received message and not report the received message to a remote service for further analysis. If the client device does not determine that the received message originated from a trusted sender, it will report the received message to a remote service for further analysis.

An enterprise server receives indications from client machines that a particular file is suspected of being malware. The suspect file is retrieved and the decision tree is walked using the suspect file. A leaf node is reached that identifies a particular common substring, a byte offset within the suspect file at which it is likely that the common substring begins, and a probability distribution that the common substring appears in a number of malware families. A hash value of the common substring is compared (exact or approximate) against the corresponding substring in the suspect file. If positive, a result is returned to the enterprise server indicating the probability that the suspect file is a member of a particular malware family.

A control unit can receive a first, dirty feature vector (e.g., a false miss) and determine the local CM based on the first feature vector. The control unit can receive a trial feature vector representing the trial data stream. The control unit can determine that the trial data stream is dirty if a broad CM or the local CM determines that the trial feature vector is dirty. In some examples, the local CM can define a dirty region in a feature space. The control unit can determine the local CM based on the first feature vector and other clean or dirty feature vectors, e.g., a clean feature vector nearest to the first feature vector.

A threat management facility generates a simulated phishing threat based on one or more characteristics of a network user. Based on whether the user fails to respond appropriately to the simulated phishing threat, the threat management facility may implement one or more prophylactic measures to remediate the security weakness exposed by the user's failure to respond appropriately to the simulated phishing threat. For example, a security policy for an endpoint associated with the user may be adjusted to address the security weakness. Additionally, or alternatively, the user may be enrolled in training directed at reducing the likelihood that the user will be the victim of an actual phishing attack in the future.

By tracking such data for various computing objects and correlating these labels to malware occurrences, rules can be written for distribution to endpoints to facilitate threat detection based on, e.g., interactions of labeled objects, changes to object labels, and so forth. In this manner, threat detection based on complex interactions of computing objects can be characterized in a platform independent manner and pre-processed on endpoints without requiring significant communications overhead with a remote threat management facility.

This may include simple labeling schemes to distinguish between objects, e.g., trusted/untrusted processes or corporate/private data. This may also include more granular labeling schemes such as a three-tiered scheme that identifies a category (e.g., financial, e-mail, game), static threat detection attributes (e.g., signatures, hashes, API calls), and explicit identification (e.g., what a file or process calls itself). By tracking such data for various computing objects and correlating these labels to malware occurrences, rules can be written for distribution to endpoints to facilitate threat detection based on, e.g., interactions of labeled objects, changes to object labels, and so forth. In this manner, threat detection based on complex interactions of computing objects can be characterized in a platform independent manner and pre-processed on endpoints without requiring significant communications overhead with a remote threat management facility.

The disclosed techniques relate to a graph-based network security analytic framework to combine multiple sources of information and security knowledge in order to detect risky behaviors and potential threats. In some examples, the input can be anomaly events or simply regular events. The entities associated with the activities can be grouped into smaller time units, e.g., per day. The riskiest days of activity can be found by computing a risk score for each day and according to the features in the day. A graph can be built with links between the time units. The links can also receive scoring based on a number of factors. The resulting graph can be compared with known security knowledge for adjustments. Threats can be detected based on the adjusted risk score for a component (i.e., a group of linked entities) as well as a number of other factors.

Intrusion detection systems and methods monitor legal control messages in an operational control system to detect subtly malicious sequences of control messages with undesirable emergent effects on devices in the operational control system. A message provenance component may investigate system-level correlations between messages rather than detecting if individual messages are anomalous. A semantic fuzzing component may search, based on the operational effect of candidate message sequences, the space of legal messages for sequences that cause actual harm. Behavior oracles may be used to test message sequences to identify sequences that induce drift towards a failure state. The intrusion detection system is able to prevent harm and disruption arising from control messages that individually appear legitimate and benign but that, in combination with other messages, can cause undesirable outcomes.

Presented herein are intrusion detection systems and algorithms for networked vehicle controllers and devices, methods for making/using such systems and algorithms, and motor vehicles with a network of ECUs and network-profiling intrusion detection capabilities. A method for detecting intrusions into an onboard network of vehicle controllers includes determining the current state of operation of a vehicle, and identifying a network traffic pattern table corresponding to the vehicle's current state of operation. Network traffic flow for one of the in- vehicle controllers is monitored when exchanging data over the Ethernet communication interface while the motor vehicle is operating in the current state of operation. The method then determines if a traffic characteristic of the monitored network traffic flow is outside a calibrated boundary that is determined from the network traffic pattern table. Responsive to the monitored network traffic flow characteristic being outside the calibrated boundary, the method executes a remedial action response.

While distributed processing provides numerous benefits over single-device processing, distributed query execution engines can be significantly more difficult to develop that single-device engines. Embodiments of this disclosure enable the use of a single-device engine to support distributed processing, by dividing a query into multiple stages, each of which can be executed by multiple, concurrent executions of a single-device engine. Between stages, data can be shuffled between executions of the engine, such that individual executions of the engine are provided with a complete set of records needed to implement an individual stage. Because single-device engines can be significantly less difficult to develop, use of the techniques described herein can enable a distributed system to rapidly support multiple query languages.

During operation, the system sends, from a computer system to a remote system, a request for a local time at the remote system and records a time of transmission of the request. Next, the system obtains, from the remote system, a response to the request, wherein the response includes the local time of the remote system. The system then computes a difference between the time of transmission and the local time of the remote system to determine a time offset that accounts for a time difference between the computer system and the remote system. Finally, the system uses the time offset to standardize timestamps in time-series data received from the remote system, wherein standardizing the timestamps associated with the time-series data comprises adjusting the timestamps to conform to a time standard.

A Secure Remote Peripheral Encryption Tunnel (SeRPEnT) can be implemented in a portable embedded device for the Universal Serial Bus (USB) with a much more restricted attack surface than a general purpose client computer. The SeRPEnT device can comprise a small, low-power cryptographic switchboard that can operate in a trusted path mode and a pass-through mode. In the trusted path mode, the SeRPEnT device can tunnel connected peripherals through the client to a server with Virtual Machine (VM)-hosted applications. In the pass-through mode, the SeRPEnT device can pass-through the connected peripherals to the client system, allowing normal use of the local system by the user. SeRPEnT can also enable secure transactions between the user and server applications by only allowing input to the VMs to originate from the SeRPEnT device.

A method for fetching a content from a web server to a client device is disclosed, using tunnel devices serving as intermediate devices. The client device accesses an acceleration server to receive a list of available tunnel devices. The requested content is partitioned into slices, and the client device sends a request for the slices to the available tunnel devices. The tunnel devices in turn fetch the slices from the data server, and send the slices to the client device, where the content is reconstructed from the received slices. A client device may also serve as a tunnel device, serving as an intermediate device to other client devices. Similarly, a tunnel device may also serve as a client device for fetching content from a data server. The selection of tunnel devices to be used by a client device may be in the acceleration server, in the client device, or in both. The partition into slices may be overlapping or non-overlapping, and the same slice (or the whole content) may be fetched via multiple tunnel devices.

Methods and apparatus for efficient data transfer within a user space network stack. Unlike prior art monolithic networking stacks, the exemplary networking stack architecture described hereinafter includes various components that span multiple domains (both in-kernel, and non-kernel). For example, unlike traditional socket based communication, disclosed embodiments can transfer data directly between the kernel and user space domains. Direct transfer reduces the per-byte and per-packet costs relative to socket based communication. A user space networking stack is disclosed that enables extensible, cross-platform-capable, user space control of the networking protocol stack functionality. The user space networking stack facilitates tighter integration between the protocol layers (including TLS) and the application or daemon. Exemplary systems can support multiple networking protocol stack instances (including an in-kernel traditional network stack).
